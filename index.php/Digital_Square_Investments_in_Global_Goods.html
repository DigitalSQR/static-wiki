<p>Tamanu is a fit-for-purpose patient-level electronic medical record (EMR) designed to address the distinct healthcare challenges of the Pacific. Our goal is to ensure that patients in the Pacific can travel and participate in the global economy. Including vaccination certificates in Tamanu will help us reach this goal. This investment would go towards developing vaccination certificates (including secure Visible Digital Seals - VDS) in line with the World Health Organization’s Digital documentation of COVID-19 certificates: vaccination status (DDCC: VS): technical specifications and implementation guidance. In addition, the system will align with HL7 FHIR, a free and open data exchange standard, to ensure that data for the DDCC: VS is captured in a consistent and interoperable way. In addition, we will be able to code the data using either the ICAO or EUDCC standards.

<p>DHIS2 is the national scale health management information system (HMIS) across 55 countries and Indian states, and scaling up in an additional 33. Beyond the principal application of DHIS2 as an HMIS, we see DHIS2 being applied as national WASH, logistics, agriculture, land tenure, community health, and education information systems. Additionally, DHIS2 is now being used as the central information system for several multinational donor databases and thousands of NGO projects.  The University of Oslo aims to minimize the barriers to DHIS2 adoption and full utilization.
