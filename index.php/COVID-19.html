<ul><li>1. Enhanced MOH pages, able to store reference documents of national relevance (policies, investment plans, maturity assessments, etc)</li>
<li>2. Documentation of Project Phases providing DHA users with insights regarding the progress of a project along the software development life cycle (from ideation to scaled implementation)</li>
<li>3. Facilitating the labeling and description of multi-country deployments as  "Global Initiatives".</li>
<li>4. Facilitating the labeling of a project as research-focused and time-bound, allowing researchers to share time-critical insights and progress into Covid-19 and digital health directly with Ministries of Health and Investors</li></ul></dd></dl>

All packages are optimized for Android or web-based data collection. The COVID-19 digital data package includes standard metadata aligned with the WHO’s technical guidance on COVID-19 surveillance and case definitions and implementation guidance to enable rapid deployment in countries. The packages support:
<ul><li>1) Case-based Surveillance:  DHIS2 has released a digital data package to accelerate case detection, situation reporting, active surveillance, and response to COVID-19. The package is inspired by the Ministry of Health Sri Lanka’s pioneering design of DHIS2 tracker for COVID-19 case detection and draws on years of collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop information system standards for case-based disease surveillance.;</li>
<li>2) Contact tracing program to facilitate operations of contact tracing and with built-in relationships to the case-based tracker for enhanced analysis;</li>
<li>3) Ports of entry screening and follow up</li>
<li>4) Automated analysis of core indicators &amp; dashboards for response planning. The package also includes options for aggregate and event-based surveillance; countries can transition between data models according to realities on the ground while still capturing the most critical data points.</li></ul></li>
<li>Team has created training materials and videos for the above configurations</li>
<li>Packages translations are now available in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Russian and Norwegian. Additional languages can be added on demand.</li>

<p>Countries have access to a large, complex ecosystem of digital platforms that can support COVID-19 response. The process of selecting the most appropriate platform for a country's specific needs or context can be overwhelming without clear information about the benefits and limitations of the options. Several new resources have been developed to support in-country assessment and decisions about digital technologies for COVID response. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Johns_Hopkins_assessment">Johns Hopkins assessment</span></h3>
<p>In July 2020, Johns Hopkins published an assessment of digital platforms that have an established presence in several low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), and either have been or could be rapidly reconfigured to address COVID-19 related case management and contact tracing needs.  The assessment includes a review of the following tools: CommCare, Community Health Toolkit (CHT), DHIS2 Tracker, Go.Data, ODK, OpenSRP, RapidPro, SORMAS, and WelTel. The platforms were selected based on their existing deployment, flexibility, and adaptability for COVID-19 use cases, their ability to support multiple languages, and stakeholder interest in how these applications can be leveraged in response to COVID-19.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Digital_Square_efforts">Digital Square efforts</span></h3>
<p>In recognition that this is a rapidly evolving landscape, Digital Square has been working across donors to collate a comparison of digital tools that are currently used in the COVID-19 response. Included in the comparison is an analysis of a number of functional and non-functional requirements.  Including in this document are the following digital health tools: DHIS2, SORMAS, Go.Data, EpiInfo, CommCare, ODK, Kobo Toolbox, Excel and non-digital paper tools. This comparison is a dynamic document meant for community updates that can be accessed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cMQAZO94uTe4HULLmBRN80fPnNUwayqw3e2UT-voJbw/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" class="external text">here</a>.

<h4><span id="Map_.26_Match"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Map_&amp;_Match">Map &amp; Match</span></h4>
<p>The USAID-funded Map &amp; Match project helps countries, donors, implementing partners, and the global digital health community at large to leverage and adapt existing digital tools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world learned during the West Africa Ebola outbreak response, prioritizing the reuse and adaptation of existing digital tools is vital to quickly scale access to time-sensitive disease information and data.

<p>With funding from USAID Mali, Digital Square is working closely with the Mali Ministry of Health and partners such as CDC, Gavi, UNICEF and Global Fund to support adaptation and scale of digital health tools to support the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.  Through the end of 2021, Digital Square is specifically supporting the following activities:
</p>
<ol><li>Adapt and scale existing health information systems for COVID-19 vaccine rollout to enable real-time monitoring of vaccine availability and vaccine coverage.</li>
<li>Support MOH to transition existing paper-based systems to digital platforms (focus on digital tools for monitoring adverse side effects).</li>
<li>Harness digital tools to identify and locate persons eligible for vaccination.</li>
<li>Identify tools and applications to be made interoperable.</li>
<li>Contribute to an evaluation of a vaccination campaign in Bamako.</li></ol>
