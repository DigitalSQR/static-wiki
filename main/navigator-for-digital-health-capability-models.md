The Navigator for Digital Health Capability Models (also called the
'Navigator') enables health systems planners, implementors, evaluators,
and funders to understand the value of using maturity model-based tools,
identify and use the most appropriate tool(s), and leverage past
maturity model-based assessments to improve digital health capabilities
at the national and sub-national levels.

The Navigator includes the following components:

[A Navigator for Digital Health Capability Models: A User’s Guide](https://lib.digitalsquare.io/handle/123456789/77728)  

This guidance provides an overview on the use of maturity model-based
assessment tools; an introduction to the individual tools included in
the Navigator; guidance on how to identify the best tool(s) to meet your
assessment needs; and details on how to use tools in combination with
one another.

[Excel-based Decision Support Workbook](https://lib.digitalsquare.io/handle/123456789/77727)  

The Microsoft Excel workbook helps users:

1.  Identify and use the most appropriate maturity model-based tool(s).
2.  Leverage past maturity model-based assessments to inform new or
    planned assessments.

This Microsoft PowerPoint includes an abridged version of the User’s
Guide and can be used for working with groups that may want to use the
Excel-based Workbook but need additional information in the form of a
presentation.

[Excel-based Appendix to the Navigator](https://lib.digitalsquare.io/handle/123456789/77725)  

The appendix provides an in-depth mapping of indicators between the six
maturity model-based tools in the Navigator.

#### Technical brief: The need for a Digital Health Maturity Model Navigator

An early step in the process of developing the Navigator for Digital
Health Capability Models was to interview tool developers, implementors,
and country stakeholders to better understand motivations and goals in
using maturity model-based tools. This technical brief summarizes those
interviews.

The Navigator includes six maturity model-based tools:

1.  [Early-Stage Digital Health Investment Tool

2.  [Global Digital Health Index
    (GDHI)](https://www.digitalhealthindex.org)
3.  [Health Information Systems Interoperability Maturity Toolkit
    (IMM)](https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/tools/health-information-systems-interoperability-toolkit.html)
4.  [Information Systems for Health Toolkit
    (IS4H)](https://www3.paho.org/ish/index.php/en/is4h-basics)
5.  [Survey, Count, Optimize, Review, Enable (SCORE) Essential
    Interventions](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/334005/9789240009837-eng.pdf)
6.  [Health Information System Stages of Continuous Improvement (SOCI)
    Toolkit](https://www.measureevaluation.org/his-strengthening-resource-center/his-stages-of-continuous-improvement-toolkit.html)

The Navigator was developed by the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and Digital Square, with funding and technical advisory
support from the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID). An advisory team composed of representatives from USAID, the
World Health Organization, World Bank, the United Nations Children’s
Fund, Country Health Information Systems and Data Use (CHISU) / John
Snow, Inc., and the Kati Collective provided input and suggestions.
Members of the Digital Health and Interoperability Working Group’s Small
Working Group on maturity models provided valuable input and feedback on
the various iterations of the Navigator and contributed to the
Navigator’s testing.
