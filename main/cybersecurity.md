Digital Square's FHIR-focused webinar series provides guidance to help
digital health developers, innovators, digital public goods and global
goods developers, and implementers better understand how to use FHIR to
address specific use cases, such as technical guidance for COVID-19
vaccination certificates. This work also increases the maturity of FHIR
through the use and feedback to HL7 through their collaborative process.

Digital Square hosts monthly webinars to enhance digital health's
capacity. The FHIR training material on this site is designed for
digital health leaders with some or limited prior experience and
knowledge of FHIR. All sessions are recorded and shared here.
