Digital Square partners with innovators to increase the availability,
adaptability, and maturity of high-quality software, service, and
content options for countries—including [health-focused, mature Digital
Public Goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/DPG-GlobalGoods.pdf).
Digital Square supports global goods by:

- **Administering an inclusive digital health procurement process by
  allocating global goods investments transparently and with community
  input**. Digital Square [makes
  investments](https://wiki.digitalsquare.io/index.php/Digital_Square_Investments_in_Global_Goods)
  in global goods primarily via the [Open Application
  Process](https://wiki.digitalsquare.io/index.php/Grant_Solicitation_Processes),
  which is an innovative procurement solution that fosters collaboration
  and agility.
- **Managing an active community of global goods
  partners.**<a href="The_global_goods_community" class="wikilink"
  title="The global goods community">The global goods community</a>
  allows partners to connect and learn from each other’s best practices,
  in turn improving the interoperability of software. The community
  participates in monthly webinars, contributes to quarterly
  newsletters, co-creates publications, and participates in our annual
  Global Good Innovators meeting.
- **Coordinating with stakeholders on digital public goods alignment**.
  Digital Square is closely coordinating with the [Digital Public Goods
  Alliance (DPGA)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) and use of global
  goods for specific health vertical use cases through the WHO
  Clearinghouse. These efforts will enable countries and investors to
  increase confidence in the specific digital tools to be prioritized
  for scale and adaptation in countries. Through this engagement,
  Digital Square will refresh its prioritization framework and Open
  Application Process to align more closely with tools formally vetted
  through the DPGA.

  including country governments, in understanding, aligning, and
  applying these standards.**

    standards in health system design and support technical teams in
    adopting standards in their tools.

  - Digital Square facilitates **knowledge-sharing** platforms to raise
    awareness of standards, increase feasibility, and contribute to a
    range of tools that allow users to recognize the short- and
    long-term impact of the standards.

    partners and provides ongoing **support to a range of other global
    goods partners**.

## The Testing Harness

Digital Square has supported the development of a test harness and
testing framework that will facilitate testing the conformance of
technologies to the OpenHIE Architecture specification and health and
data content, as specified by WHO SMART Guidelines. This testing
solution will be leveraged by anyone wanting to test compliance of
digital health solutions to WHO SMART Guidelines compliance requirements
and/or their own defined requirements.
