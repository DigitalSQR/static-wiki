# OpenMRS

OpenMRS is a scalable, modular, interoperable, open source electronic
medical records platform (EMR), designed for use with other health
information systems and in resource-constrained settings. Since OpenMRS
launch in 2007, more than 6,700 healthcare clinics in over 35 countries
are using OpenMRS to provide improved healthcare to 15.8 million
patients. OpenMRS provides health care workers with easier and greater
access to data from longitudinal patient records that can inform patient
care. Increasingly, data from OpenMRS is also used by digital health
leaders to inform the public health decisions needed to achieve the UN
Sustainable Development Goals, measure progress towards UNAIDS 95-95-95
targets for HIV epidemic control, respond to outbreaks such as Ebola and
COVID-19, and achieve universal health coverage.

As a result of better healthcare information technology, countries where
OpenMRS is predominantly used have seen a reduction in AIDS infection
rates as well as deaths of both AIDS and malaria. Countries such as
Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, Haiti, Rwanda, and Uganda have widely
adopted OpenMRS as their premier EMR platform or have declared it to be
their official EMR.

### Approach

OpenMRS, as an open-source project, provides a unique solution which
puts local providers and patients at the center of their health
information ecosystem. It allows for low-resource settings, in
particular, to benefit from the contributions of others while being able
to customize their own technologies. This is a foundational
transformation that allows for local innovation and the development of
new solutions to difficult health-related problems. When OpenMRS
implementers customize the OpenMRS platform and reference application in
response to local user needs and country context, the resulting OpenMRS
implementation becomes an essential point-of-service system in a
country's health information exchange architecture. The OpenMRS
community accompanies this work with a model that supports community
development, capacity building and local ownership.

OpenMRS products aim to ensure that patients get the right, timely, and
appropriate care; that healthcare workers have timely, accurate, and
complete information; and that organizations can access the data they
need to improve the efficiency and quality of care delivery. OpenMRS
implementing organizations extend OpenMRS products to create localized
EMR systems that support a variety of care programs, including HIV, TB,
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), maternal and child health (MCH),
COVID-19, and oncology.

An OpenMRS EMR system is built using the three OpenMRS building blocks:
the core platform, concept dictionary, and foundational, ready-to-use
modules (OpenMRS Add Ons and/or OpenMRS 3 Apps), offering users the
following, broad features and functionality:

- Retrospective data entry or point-of-care
- Registration and appointment management
- Clinic dashboards, queues, and patient lists
- Patient chart and in-chart dashboards
- Labs orders and results
- Medications and pharmacy
- Dashboards and reporting
- Concept dictionary management
- Standards-based data exchange with other health information systems at
  a health facility and with a national health information exchange
  architecture (laboratory, client registry, shared health records)
- System administration
- Implementation tooling (forms, configuration, maintenance, etc.)

### Implementations

In 2005, OpenMRS was initially implemented at a few facilities in Kenya,
Rwanda, and South Africa with a specific focus on supporting HIV care
and treatment. Since then, adoption of OpenMRS products has spread to at
least 6,745 health facilities in 35+ countries. Health care workers at
these facilities use OpenMRS to provide care for more than 15.8 million
patients enrolled in a wide variety of programs, now including HIV, TB,
Maternal and Child Health, Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), and most
recently, COVID-19.

The primary OpenMRS users are the health care providers who care for
patients at health care facilities in low and middle income countries.
The doctors and nurses who use OpenMRS strive to deliver quality health
care to patients in the shortest period of time. They seek to make the
best decisions about patient care based on the information captured in
the system from the moment a patient arrives at their facility to the
end, when a patient leaves the facility. They look to OpenMRS to be fast
and easy to navigate, to look up a complete patient record quickly, and
capture patient data accurately.
