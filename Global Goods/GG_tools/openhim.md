# OpenHIM

The OpenHIM is a middleware component designed to ease interoperability
between disparate information systems. It provides secure communications
and data governance as well as support for routing, orchestrating and
translating requests as they flow between systems.

### Approach

The OpenHIM is a general-purpose enterprise service bus middleware
application primarily focused on health information exchange solutions
in low-resource settings. It is a reference implementation of the
interoperability layer of the Open Health Information Exchange
(OpenHIE).

### Implementations

Jembi has implemented the OpenHIM in several countries in Africa,
including Rwanda (Rwanda Health Information Exchange), South Africa
(MomConnect), Ethiopia (Ethiopian Public Health Institute) and
internationally (DATIM). There is anecdotal evidence of OpenHIM being
used in several other African countries.

The OpenHIM is also a core component of OpenCRVS.
