## Digital Square Global Goods and Digital Public Goods

[Digital Public Goods
(DPGs)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods/) are open
source software, open data, open artificial intelligence (AI) models,
open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other
applicable laws and best practices, do no harm by design, and help
attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). DPGs include all of the
SDGs, such as agriculture, finance, climate, etc.

Digital Square Global Goods have a close relationship to DPGs, in that
they overlap with many aspects of the DPG Standard. However, the
difference stems from the fact that Digital Square Global Goods are
focused on SDG 3 (Health and Wellness) and primarily focused on the
health domain with a market focus of LMIC settings. Global Goods are
also tools with an identified drive towards strengthening the maturity,
interoperability, and shelf readiness. DPGs are similar to global goods,
with different but overlapping standards.  

All Global Goods can be seen as Digital Public Goods, but not all
Digital Public Goods are Global Goods. Digital Square Global Goods can
be seen as a collection of DPGs that are focused on health that are
impactful, scalable and adaptable to different countries and contexts
and have active focuses to become more interoperable, deployable and
better serving LMIC settings.

While the majority of Digital Square global goods will meet the
standards required for approval as a DPG, there are two reasons why not
all DPGs will be Digital Square global goods:  

- Digital Square exclusively evaluates solutions relevant to the health
  sector whereas DPGs are sector agnostic.  
- Digital Square facilitates a [peer review
  process](https://wiki.digitalsquare.io/index.php/Grant_Solicitation_Processes#Open_Application_Process_.28OAP.29)
  that assesses maturity and aligns and weighs in on [“awarding” the
  title of Digital Square global

  In contrast, DPGs have no maturity requirement. 

Digital Square closely [coordinates with the Digital Public Goods
Alliance (DPGA) and the technical leads at the WHO
Clearinghouse](https://wiki.digitalsquare.io/index.php/Main_Page#Digital_Public_Goods_Alliance_&_the_WHO_Digital_Clearing_House)
to align the approval processes for Digital Square global goods and
DPGs.
