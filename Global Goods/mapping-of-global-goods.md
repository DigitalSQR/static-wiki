The global goods mapping tool is a data-driven visualization that
highlights countries with global good deployments and shows the number
and names of global goods in use. *To view a list of global goods
deployed in a particular country, hover over the country. Alternatively,
select one or more global goods in the filter on the right to see where
they have been deployed.*

**Data Disclaimer**: *The data contained in the map is self-reported by
the global goods community and is updated periodically; as such, there
may be variances in the countries and deployments listed. For more
information about the countries and deployments, we encourage you to
