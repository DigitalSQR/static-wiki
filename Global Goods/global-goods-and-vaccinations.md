Digital technologies can act as accelerators for the introduction,
deployment, and scale-up of vaccines in countries to assist health
workers, communities, and other stakeholders. The use of digital tools
and the data they enable facilitate rapid, iterative, and scalable
approaches to ensure vaccines are safely delivered to health facilities,
that health workers are equipped to administer them, and that
communities are informed and confident in their efficacy.

# Global Good Adaptations for COVID-19 Vaccine Introduction

Dimagi has developed a template solution for Equitable and Effective
COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery. The solution tracks and supports every client
before, during, and after the vaccination process while providing
analytics and visualizations to monitor the progression of vaccine
delivery. It provides direct digital support to health providers
administering vaccines (via apps), people getting vaccinated (via
messaging), vaccine managers and supervisors (via analytics and
dashboards), and community advocates (via apps or messaging).

DHIS2 has several ready-to-install digital data packages to support
COVID-19 vaccine delivery (including for COVAX) based on WHO guidelines.
All packages are optimized for Android or web-based data collection,
including in offline mode. The DHIS2 toolkit for COVID-19 vaccine
delivery expands field-tested designs and tools from the WHO DHIS2
immunization data toolkit to enable countries to rapidly update existing
systems to support the equitable delivery of COVID-19 vaccines at scale,
while strengthening existing national DHIS2-based immunization systems
for sustainable impact across all aspects of vaccine-preventable disease
interventions. The toolkit supports:
<ul>
<li>Measure uptake, coverage &amp; equitable distribution over time, by
geography and across risk groups: The DHIS2 WHO EPI module has been
expanded for COVID-19 vaccine data for routine facility data on
vaccination utilization, wastage, cold chain &amp; outreach data</li>
<li>Supply chain readiness &amp; traceability of vaccines down to points
of service delivery: Facility &amp; last-mile logistics data module: WHO
approved health logistics metadata with barcode/QR scanning
capabilities</li>
<li>Ensure that individuals can be monitored for the full course of
multi-dose regimen: Immunization eRegistry (EIR) package for
longitudinal tracking &amp; follow-up of individuals</li>
<li>Provide a personal vaccination record/certificate: Electronic Health
Certificates linked with Immunization eRegistry and integration with
digital vaccination cards</li>
<li>Multiple distribution strategies; novel &amp; innovative
distribution approaches: Mass campaigns &amp; supplemental immunization
activities monitoring adapted for COVID-19 distribution strategies</li>
<li>Vaccine safety monitoring: Adverse Events Following Immunization
(AEFI) Tracker: WHO approved module for strengthening vaccine safety
surveillance</li>

# Country Support

## Mali

With funding from USAID Mali, Digital Square is working closely with the
Mali Ministry of Health and partners such as CDC, Gavi, UNICEF and
Global Fund to support adaptation and scale of digital health tools to
support the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. Through the end of 2021,
Digital Square is specifically supporting the following activities:

1.  Adapt and scale existing health information systems for COVID-19
    vaccine rollout to enable real-time monitoring of vaccine
    availability and vaccine coverage.
2.  Support MOH to transition existing paper-based systems to digital
    platforms (focus on digital tools for monitoring adverse side
    effects).
3.  Harness digital tools to identify and locate persons eligible for
    vaccination.
4.  Identify tools and applications to be made interoperable.
5.  Contribute to an evaluation of a vaccination campaign in Bamako.

For more information on these activities or to coordinate with the
Digital Square team, please contact [Caitlin
Bowman](mailto:cbowman@path.org).

## UNICEF/WHO Digital Health Center of Excellence (DICE)

Many countries do not have fully functioning digital systems or
solutions required to address health and information systems priorities
in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as post-pandemic
health systems’ needs. Digital Square and the newly formed UNICEF/WHO
Digital Health Center of Excellence (DICE) are proactively looking for
opportunities to collaborate to support countries’ wanting to invest in
sustainable and scalable deployments of carefully chosen digital
solutions for COVID-19 pandemic response plans. DICE is committed to
supporting countries harness appropriate digital public goods, many of
which are mature and already integrated into national systems, to
provide substantial multilayered support to the COVID-19 pandemic using
a health system strengthening lens; from planning distribution of
commodities and vaccines, tracking supplies, surveillance and case
detection, monitoring coverage of services, and communicating to
generate demand and reduce misinformation. . Digital Square’s Mission is
to connect health leaders with the resources they need for digital
transformation. Through our collective partnership, we aim to not only
support country needs now, but also to help country leaders build
stronger, more sustainable digital systems, which will improve health
outcomes beyond the current pandemic.”
