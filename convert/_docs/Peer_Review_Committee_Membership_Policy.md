This is the Governance Overview of the Digital Square Peer Review
Committee.

## Role of the Peer Review Committee {#role_of_the_peer_review_committee}

The PRC is not a governing body and its recommendations to the Governing
Board are non- binding; however, the PRC plays a critical role as
technical experts, assessing the technical and programmatic
appropriateness of submitted proposals. The PRCâs role is to:

- Evaluate proposals against global goods criteria and provide technical
  feedback to authors
- Evaluate the programmatic and contextual appropriateness of a proposal
  in meeting health system challenges.
- Evaluate submitted proposals and assign green, amber, or red lit
  status.

## Responsibilities

- Review all investment proposals, utilizing the global goods criteria.
- Support the dhi by voting on proposals to move forward for investment,
  investigate further, or decline outright.
- Support the dhi management team by providing additional technical
  guidance as requested in regard to green or amber lit investment
  proposals.
- Share knowledge and provide technical and strategic advice in areas of
  expertise.

## Composition

The PRC is comprised of a diverse set of the foremost leaders and
thinkers in digital health technology. The PRC does not have a limit on
the number of Members. Seats are allocated to organizations, referred to
as Member Organizations. There is no term limit. The PRC is comprised of
Member Organizations and Representatives who meet the following
membership criteria:

- Are recognized as experts in global health informatics, information
  technology, software development, and/or interoperability.
- Have expertise in regional and global digital health systems.
- Fulfill a balanced representation of the diverse group of stakeholders
  in digital health, including country governments, donor organizations,
  implementing organizations, technology vendors, and other
  constituencies.
- Willingness to comply with required participation as described in the
  governance documents.

## Conflict of interest {#conflict_of_interest}

Members will disclose organizational or personal/financial conflicts
before proposal review. The Chair will determine the scope of the
conflict and the necessity for recusal. It is important to note that
members are not likely to be recused from the review and feedback
process on a proposal, but rather just voting, as their feedback is
integral to the âpeerâ in Peer Review Committee. This will be applied
fairly but may vary by situation.

## Voting

Each PRC member organization receives one vote. Representatives and
Alternates should come to a consensus in order to cast one
organizational. All votes are weighed equally. PATH as the ex officio
chair does not have a vote. The PRC member organizations cast their
votes for green-, amber-, or red-light on the proposals. The breakdown
of the organizational votes is then communicated to the Governing Board.

In the case of the DH&I WG group, each organization within the group
receives one vote, all of which are weighed equally. The majority vote
within the DH&I WG is then cast as the DH&I WG organizational vote. In
the event of a tie between green and amber, the vote will be cast as
green. In the event of a tie between green and red, the vote will be
cast as amber. In the event of a tie between amber and red, the vote
will be cast as amber.
