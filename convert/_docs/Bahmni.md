# Bahmni

Bahmni is an open source Hospital Information System (HIS) and
Electronic Medical Record (EMR) product led by the Bahmni Coalition, a
group of companies and non-profit organizations that provide leadership
to Bahmni. It is a project of the OpenMRS Foundation. Bahmni's mission
is to provide sophisticated digital healthcare to improve patient care
in low-resource settings. Bahmni aims to provide a high-quality, free,
open source, comprehensive Health Information Management System (HIMS)
solution that is comparable to the best tools available in high income
countries. Bahmni combines and enhances existing open-source products
into a single solution. It integrates:

- OpenMRS for electronic medical records and patient management
- OpenERP for inventory, billing, financial accounting
- OpenELIS for laboratory management
- Dcm4chee for DICOM and PACS

Bahmni improves healthcare delivery through efficient information
management, so that decision-making is faster and more reliable across
the organization; doctors are enabled to be more effective and accurate
while providing care; administrators have the information they need real
time. Bahmni is an easy to use, complete, open-source Hospital
Information System (HIS) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) under
development since November 2012. Bahmni aims to meet the needs of
hospitals in low resource environments by leveraging a tapestry of
existing open-source products. The information that Bahmni makes
accessible helps healthcare providers to improve efficiency and quality
of patient care, reduce errors in clinical encounters and advocate for
issues related to public health.

### Approach

Bahmni integrates and builds on top of:

- OpenMRS for electronic medical records and patient management
- Odoo for inventory, billing, financial accounting
- dcm4chee for DICOM and PACS
- OpenELIS for laboratory management

The main features of Bahmni are as follows:

- Patient Registration: Register patients with their demographics,
  identification, contact, relationships & other details. Search
  patients. Print patient ID cards.
- Appointment Management: Schedule, manage patient appointments
- Clinical Services: Capture, maintain and access clinical records of
  patients. Create general and disease specific forms. Capture drug
  prescriptions and order lab, radiology, other investigations, or
  procedures. Use pre-created drug prescription templates.
- Laboratory Management: Manage patients\' orders, samples, and tests.
  Get bird\'s eye view of the lab\'s workload. Send samples for
  referrals.
- Inpatient Management: Manage patient\'s admission, perform bed
  assignments, and track ward occupancy.
- PACS Integration: Create radiology orders, view DICOM images
- Telemedicine: Teleconsultation appointments, encounters
- Operation Theatre / Surgery scheduling
- Stock Management: Manage, track, reorder medicines and other supplies.
  Move and monitor stock levels.
- Billing, Accounting: Manage and maintain accurate records of all bills
  and financial transactions.
- Reporting: Perform operational, clinical, and public health reporting

Bahmni is:

- An Integrated Solution - Manage patient information across
  registration, point of care, investigations, and billing
- Intuitively Designed - Simple to use at the point of care, with
  minimal training required
- Flexible - Allows for unique workflows and processes based on each
  hospital\'s needs
- Modular - Choose parts of Bahmni and integrate them with existing
  systems
- Infrastructure Appropriate - Hosted and operated at the hospital site,
  requiring no dependence on the Internet
- Adaptable - Bahmni can be used on a variety of devices, including
  tablets and laptops

The primary users of Bahmni are clinicians - physicians, dentists,
pharmacists, physician assistants, field health workers, nurses,
hospital Staff - Front desk, receptionists, scribes, billing and
administrative staff, Pharmacy and Store managers, medical Technicians -
Lab technicians, radiographers, hospital Administrators: To see facility
level reports for clinical and operational decisions. The end users of
Bahmni are typically doctors, specialists, clinical and non-clinical
staff at hospitals located in remote parts of the world, most of whom
rarely use technology in their daily life. Bahmni was designed to be
used by such users. Its configurable interface allows clinical users of
different specialties to design forms to capture the data they need.
Bahmni is also designed to be used by users in multiple languages.

### Implementations

Bahmni has been in development since early 2013. It was piloted at the
Jan Swasthya Sahyog (JSS) Hospital in Chhattisgarh, India in October
2013. It was introduced to the wider community at the OpenMRS conference
in 2015. Since then, the adoption has been growing organically. In a
short span of 9 years, Bahmni has been chosen for national-level rollout
in Lesotho, Bangladesh, South Sudan, Cameroon and Tanzania by the
ministries of health of these countries. The endTB project consortium, a
group of well-respected global health organizations - Médecins Sans
Frontières (MSF), Partners in Health (PIH) and Interactive Research and
Development (IRD), chose Bahmni as the EMR for a large implementation
trial for the new Tuberculosis (TB) drug regimen.

According to Bahmni\'s best estimate, thay have more than 500 known
sites worldwide in over 50 countries using Bahmni. Over twenty million
patient records have been managed via Bahmni. Bahmni was designed for
use in low-resource settings. Currently, it is used predominantly in
Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Typical organizations that
form Bahmni's core user segments are: Large NGOs (e.g., MSF, Cure
International), Country Ministries of Health (MoH) - for country-wide
implementations, small and medium-sized for-profit and NGO hospitals and
research institutes.

Bahmni is usually chosen as the EMR for healthcare institutions looking
to digitize patient care because of the following advantages: It
replaces much more inefficient paper records, its customizability
(localization, calendar), integrations with other systems, strong
reporting capabilities. Additionally, Bahmni is preferred over
alternatives because it is easy to use, it is open source, and it has an
active community behind it, including the much larger OpenMRS community.
Less commonly, Bahmni also replaces existing EMR implementations.

At the urging of India's National Health Authority (NHA), the Bahmni
community is building Bahmni Lite, a lightweight version of Bahmni more
suited to OPD settings in small clinics. Bahmni Lite will also be
cloud-native to take advantage of increasing internet connectivity and
allow clinics to use Bahmni in Software as a Service mode for as little
as USD 20 a month. This will also reduce costs to implementers and allow
for efficiencies of scale.

In 2021, Bahmni became the first (and to date, only) open source HMIS to
be certified for all three milestones of India's Ayushman Bharat Digital
Mission (ABDM) network. It is being considered as a strong option for
ABDM roll-out in multiple states in India and has already been piloted
in the state of Bihar.

Bahmni has been recognized as a Digital Public Good by the [Digital
Public Goods Alliance
(DPGA)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/bahmni.html). It has
also recently (September 2022) been listed in the [United Nations
Development Programme's (UNDP) Digital X Solution
Catalogue](https://digitalx.undp.org/catalog_1.html).
