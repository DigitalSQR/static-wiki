# OpenFn

OpenFn is the leading Digital Public Good for workflow automation. It is
used by governments and NGOs in 40+ countries to securely automate
business processes, exchange critical information, and achieve
interoperability. Integration strengthens existing health systems, and
automation decreases the costs (in time & money) and error-rate (by
eliminating human-error) of complex, multi-step processes, allowing
organizations to focus more of their resources on the critical, human
aspects of their work.

### Approach

OpenFn is a digital public good for workflow automation. It connects any
application and enables interoperability and scale by helping
organizations standardize and automate the key aspects of their health
programs that cut across multiple systems. Implementers use OpenFn to
automate business processes or data exchange workflows. When implemented
for the health domain, OpenFn can be leveraged for use cases such as
syncing medical records between systems, performing data validation
steps and complex business logic to trigger different actions in target
systems (e.g., sending alerts, making payments, initiating other
workflows), or applying health standards (FHIR HL-7) to the data to be
exchanged.

While OpenFn end-beneficiaries are the people who get more efficient and
effective healthcare thanks to automation on the platform, OpenFn users
are health and IT professionals responsible for designing, managing, and
delivering technology implementations that facilitate these health
interventions.

The technologies may include health information systems, disease
surveillance systems, mobile data collection apps, SMS and messaging
platforms, payment gateways, analytics tools, and many more tools common
in digital health ecosystems.

### Implementations

OpenFn is used by 44+ organizations working across 40 countries,
including government ministries in Thailand, Cambodia, and Ethiopia,
UNICEF, and dozens of iNGOs. Since its inception in 2014, OpenFn has
been designed to comply with open standards, can connect with any
application, and provides more than 60 out-of-box adaptors to simplify
integration with critical digital public goods like DHIS2, CommCare,
Kobo Toolbox, ODK, OpenMRS, RapidPro and many more.
