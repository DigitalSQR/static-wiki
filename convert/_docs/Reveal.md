# Reveal

Reveal is an open-source digital global good that enables country
governments and implementing partners to use geospatial data and
technology to efficiently and effectively microplan and then deliver
life-saving intervention campaigns.

### Approach

Reveal supports decision-makers and intervention managers by guiding and
tracking the delivery of in-field activities with precision and holding
field teams accountable for action. Reveal uses smart maps and
technology appropriate for low-resource settings to monitor the coverage
of interventions as they happen. Modeled on the mSpray and DiSARM tools,
Reveal helps to optimize available resources and ensure no one is missed
in the process. To date, Reveal has been used to plan and deploy routine
data collection and campaigns for malaria, neglected tropical disease,
as well as social behavior change data. Other use cases include vaccine
planning and delivery, TB treatment, Vitamin A campaigns, and routine
child health services. Reveal users include government and implementers
of health programs who are involved in the planning/microplanning and
delivery of health interventions. This includes central-level Ministry
of Health staff, as well as district-based managers. End users of the
mobile client include field teams, community health workers or community
drug distributors.

### Implementations

Reveal is currently being actively used, or has been used recently in
the following countries: Mali, Senegal, Nigeria, Kenya, Angola, Zambia,
