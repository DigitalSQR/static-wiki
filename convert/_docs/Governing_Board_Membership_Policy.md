nonvoting Chair. Seats will be filled by both individuals and

development field. â¢ One to two globally recognized leaders who are
considered to have a key role in contributing to the longer-term vision
for Opal. PATH will act as Chair of the Board. Each Member will be
allotted one vote, other than the Chair, whose role is ex officio and
does not include voting rights, except in the instance of a tie. 3.0.
Member selection criteria 3.1. CommitmentâAvailability and commitment to

and Recusal Policy. 4.0. Member selection process 4.1. List of
candidatesâThe Opal management team, with guidance from the Director,
existing Board Members, Chair, and other stakeholders, will prepare a
list of individuals who meet the eligibility criteria for Board
membership. 4.2. SelectionâThe existing Board Members, Director, and
Chair will recruit Board Members who are willing to fulfill the
expectations of membership on the Board. 5.0. Membership 5.1.
Designation of seatsâThe Boardâs 13 seats will be filled by the
following stakeholders: implementing organizations, donor agencies and
foundations, technical experts from digital health product development,
and individuals. Members may serve in one of three capacities: as an
individual, as a Representative of their organization, or in a dual
capacityâas individuals and as representatives of their organization.
Members will be chosen both for their individual expertise and
leadership qualities and for their ability to represent the interests of
stakeholders. For this reason, should a Member change organizational
affiliation or shift positions or portfolios within his/her
organization, the Board Chair has the right to ask for that Memberâs
resignation in order to maintain the intended balance of representation
on the Board. 5.2. Member OrganizationsâFor seats filled by
organizations, the organization will be responsible for appointing an
individual to serve as its Representative on the Board, as well as an
Alternate. The Representative must have the capacity and authority to
represent the Member Organization in discussions and decision-making.
Each Member Organization may change its Representative at its own
discretion; however, the Member Organization is required to notify the
Board Chair at least four weeks in advance. 5.3. Individual MembersâIf a
Member is an individual, he/she may appoint a proxy, approved by the
Chair and the Director. Individual Members should complete terms of two
years, but if they must leave the Board, they are required to notify the
Board Chair at least four weeks in advance. 5.4. Individual Member
affiliationâIndividual Members are chosen for their individual expertise
and leadership qualities and for their ability to represent the
interests of stakeholders. For this reason, should an Individual Member
change organizational affiliation or shift positions or portfolios
within their organization, the Board Chair has the right to ask for that
Memberâs resignation in order to maintain the intended balance of
representation on the Board. 6.0. Terms 6.1. Length of termâThe Member
term is two years in duration (or the project end, whichever is
earlier). This term is eligible for renewal one time for one year, for a
total of up to three years of service per Member. 6.2. Renewal of
termâMember terms are renewed by reelection by a majority current Board
Members. 7.0. Member expectations 7.1. ResponsibilitiesâAll Members must
commit to acting as the critical point of connection between Opal and
the institution, organization, or sector they represent. Members are
charged with bringing the perspectives and concerns of their
organization and/or associated stakeholders to bear in Board
discussions. They must be willing to act as ambassadors and advocates
for Opal and to represent Opal at the highest levels. 7.2.
AttendanceâMembers are required to attend all web-conference and
in-person meetings of the Board. Attendance will be kept with the
meeting minutes. 7.3. AlternatesâBoard Members may send their Alternate
to participate in their absence. If neither the Member nor the Alternate
is available, a proxy may participate, with three daysâ prior written
notice and approval from the Chair. 7.4. Act in good faithâSubject to
their respective roles, Members will act in good faith in the best
interests of Opal. 7.5. Conflict of interestâAll Members will abide by
Opalâs Conflict of Interest and Recusal Policy. 7.6. Fulfillment of
obligationsâA Board Member who does not fulfill his/her responsibilities
as described in this Policy or misses two meetings without reasonable
explanation will be asked by the Chair to resign. If the Board Member
refuses to resign, a vote will be taken on the removal of the Member
from the Board. 7.7. ResignationâA Member may resign at any time by
giving notice in writing to the Chair and the Director at least four
weeks in advance. If the resignee is an Organizational Member, his/her
Alternate should fill the seat and the organization should appoint
another Alternate. In the case of Individual Members, an individual will
be nominated by the Chair, in consultation with and taking into account
recommendation from the Board, to replace the resignee. An individual
who is appointed midterm serves the remainder of the resigneeâs term and
is eligible to serve one additional two-year term. 8.0. Contact

Conflict of Interest and Recusal Policy 1.0. Purpose 1.1. Conflicts of
interestâof varying degrees of significance or natureâmay arise in the
conduct of Opalâs operations. A conflict of interest in and of itself is
not wrong and may not be unethical, but those involved in
decision-making processes on behalf of Opal must take appropriate action
to ensure disclosure of any actual, perceived, or potential conflicts of
interest. As a result, Opal will be able to properly manage conflicts of
interest and thus mitigate the operational and reputational risks
inherent in such conflicts. 1.2. The purpose of this Conflict of
Interest and Recusal Policy (this âPolicyâ) is therefore to protect the
integrity and reputation of Opalâs decision-making processes,
particularly in regard to the allocation and disbursement of resources,
by establishing procedures to identify, evaluate, and address any
actual, perceived, or potential conflicts that may arise. As a basic
principle, such conflicts must be resolved in favor of Opal. Those
involved in decision-making processes on behalf of Opal will be expected
to abide by the provisions of this Policy. 2.0. Definitions 2.1. Board
Member(s)âAny member of the Governing Board (the âBoardâ) (including
alternate Board Members). 2.2. Family member(s)âA Board Memberâs
grandparents, parents/guardians, spouse/domestic partner, siblings,
children/dependents, and/or grandchildren. 2.3. Conflict of interestâA
situation where a Board Member has an actual, perceived, or potential
organizational or financial/personal interest, as defined below, that
may: â¢ Affect the conduct of his/her duties and responsibilities with
respect to Opal. â¢ Create the perception that the Board Member is using
his/her position in Opal for organizational or personal financial gain
at the expense of Opal. 2.4. Organizational interestâAn organizational
interest arises when a Board Member is an officer, director, trustee,
partner, or (negotiating to become) an employee of an entity that may
benefit financially from a decision on which he/she would vote. 2.5.
Financial/personal interestâA Board Member has a financial/personal
interest when he/she or any family member may benefit financially or in
any other significant way from a transaction or other financial
arrangement between the initiative and an entity with which the Board
Member has: â¢ An ownership or investment interest. â¢ A senior
leadership or board member position (whether paid or unpaid). â¢ A
direct or indirect compensation arrangement, including through a
business, investment, or family member, or in the form of substantial
gifts or favors. â¢ A potential in securing any of the above. 3.0.
Conflict of interest established Members of the Board will not use their
position of influence to secure any financial gain for themselves, their
family members, or the organizations with which they are affiliated.
There are several possibilities for determining whether an actual,
perceived, or potential conflict exists: â¢ A Board Member discloses
that he/she has an actual, perceived, or potential conflict. â¢ The
Chair determines an actual, perceived, or potential conflict exists. â¢
The Board determines an actual, perceived, or potential conflict exists.
â¢ The Peer Review Committee determines an actual, perceived, or
potential conflict exists. 4.0. Categories of interest Interests can
generally be categorized according to the following types: â¢ Direct: A
direct interest in any Board decision, policy, or contract may be
established when a Board Member directly benefits from such decision,
policy, or contract through an organizational or personal/financial
interest. â¢ Indirect: An indirect interest in any Board decision,
policy, or contract may be established when a Board Member indirectly
benefits from such decision, policy, or contract through an
organizational or financial/personal interest. 5.0. Duty to disclose
5.1. A Board Member must disclose organizational and/or
financial/personal interests and the nature of such interest when he/she
becomes aware that a conflict exists, could be perceived to exist, or is
likely to occur. Such risks should be disclosed in writing to the Chair
and Director upon joining the Board (for preexisting conflicts), within
one week of the Board Member being notified of the conflict of interest
or before the next Board meeting, whichever comes first. 6.0. Recusal
6.1. Though Board Members bring their experience and affiliations to
bear for the benefit of Opal, they should also recognize their fiduciary
responsibility to put the interests of Opal before other interests when
taking decisions on behalf of Opal. Concurrently, when discharging their
duties, Board Members who represent organizations are not required to
make decisions that conflict with the constitution, regulations, rules,
and policies of the organization providing that Member to the Board.
Therefore, participation in and disclosure of any actual, perceived, or
potential conflict of interest relevant to a Board decision should be
guided by the provisions of this Policy, with any such conflict
identified and declared. 6.2. During the course of a Board meeting, a
Board Member with an actual, perceived, or potential conflict of
interest shall disclose the conflict to the Chair as soon as possible
upon learning of the possible conflict of interest and in no event later
than at the beginning of discussion of the pertinent agenda item. 6.3.
It shall be the decision of the Chair, in consultation with the
Director, to determine the scope and level of a conflicted Board
Memberâs participation in the discussion and the necessity of recusal
from deliberation, motions, and voting given the type of interest
disclosed. The minutes of the meeting shall reflect the conflicted
Memberâs disclosure and whether the conflicted Member participated in
the discussion and/or abstained from voting. 7.0. Failure to disclose
7.1. Should any Board Member have reasonable cause to believe that
another Board Member has failed to disclose an actual, perceived, or
potential conflict of interest, he/she shall inform the Chair and the
Director. The Board Member shall have an opportunity to explain the
alleged failure to disclose. The reporting Board Member should have
reasonable grounds for suspecting a violation and must do so in good
faith. Knowingly reporting false or frivolous information is contrary to
this Policy. 7.2. Failure to disclose or disputes over whether a
conflict exists may be referred to the Board for resolution. Failure to
disclose a personal interest by a Board Member who represents an
organization shall be addressed in consultation with the organization
providing that Member. 8.0. Contact Lesley-Anne Long Director, Opal,
