Digital Square is expanding engagement and support to all approved
global good implementers through our Notice cycles as well as our
request for application (RFA)s (non-Notice cycle awards). In March 2019,
we began offering monthly Global Good Webinars for the global good
innovator community. The topics of the webinars range from technical,
operational, and communications topics. Digital Square intends for these
webinars to be an opportunity for the community to share, learn, and
engage both with each other as well as the Peer Review Committee
members, who are also invited to these webinars.

## Future Webinars {#future_webinars}

- **June 27, 2019:** This webinar will embrace advocacy and
  communications, highlighting how you can leverage your Digital Square
  approval status in your resource mobilization and advocacy efforts. We
  will hear from one of our partners who will share an example of how
  they have used their status in their own resource mobilization efforts
  and pitches to donors.
