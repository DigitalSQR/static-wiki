Digital Square aims to enable the global digital health community to
move beyond the stasis caused by perpetual piloting of experimental
projects, strengthen the existing ecosystem for digital health
investments, and encourage new investments from traditional and
nontraditional donors.

Pursuant to the above, Digital Square supports identifying and
accelerating the use of global goods at the country level while
supporting development of new technologies through the global goods
investment process.

PATH is the prime recipient for the Digital Square grant. Therefore,
[Digital Square Investments in Global
Goods](Digital_Square_Investments_in_Global_Goods "Digital Square Investments in Global Goods"){.wikilink}
is provided through subawards from PATH (e.g., subagreements or
subcontracts for grant or contract funding, respectively, as appropriate
per the solicitation type and scope of work). Due to the collaborative
nature of engagement with subawardees, PATH frequently employs a
cost-reimbursement (CR) payment mechanism in order to allow for more
significant modification over the term of the subaward, if required. For
more information, please review the [Global Good Investment
Process](Global_Good_Investment_Process "Global Good Investment Process"){.wikilink}
for implementers.

This page will introduce key elements of the grants and contracts
described above.

## Solicitation Types {#solicitation_types}

A solicitation is an attempt for an entity to obtain services. There are
two types of solicitations: a request for application (RFA) or a request
for proposal (RFP). The type of solicitation indicates the type of
contracting vehicle (e.g. grant or contract), and therefore will
characterize the purpose of funding and expected relationship between
entities.

:   **Request for Application**

<!-- -->

:   An RFA will result in a grant to support programmatic objectives.

<!-- -->

:   **Request for Proposal**

<!-- -->

:   An RFP will result in contract to procure goods or services.

## Contracting Vehicles {#contracting_vehicles}

The contracting vehicle characterizes the purpose of funding and the
relationship between entities. There are two types of contracting
vehicles: grants and contracts.

Each contracting vehicle may be implemented through a variety of legally
binding documents once fully executed by designated signatories from
each contracting entity.

It is helpful to use the terms âgrantâ and âcontractâ appropriately to
avoid confusion. Although both terms indicate legality, grant implies a
collaborative arrangement between parties to define the scope of work.
While a contract indicates a scope of work prescribed by one party to be
completed by another party. This simple distinction will communicate a
significant difference to the audience about the expectations of the
relationship between entities.

### Grants

A grant is a type of legal instrument of financial assistance to carry
out a public purpose. A cooperative agreement is a type of grant
agreement that often requires the funderâs prior approval in specific
areas that are determined and identified by the funder.

The purpose of a grant is to transfer funds in order to support or carry
out a public purpose. The relationship between entities is defined by
collaboration to achieve programmatic objectives. This means that the
recipient may have its performance measured against programmatic
objectives; has responsibility for programmatic decision-making; and is
responsible for adherence to funder requirements. The recipientâs
primary responsibility is to satisfy the direct beneficiaries.

#### Grant Payment Types {#grant_payment_types}

:\***Cost Reimbursement**

:   A cost reimbursable (CR) grant provides payment based on actual
    costs. CR grants can be easily modified and allow for changes in
    scope, term, and budget. This payment type also lends itself well to
    multi-year grants for which quick start-up is needed, but the scope
    of work for later years is not fully defined. Reconciliation of
    costs via financial reporting also make it possible to issue
    advances (up to 20%) when needed and ensure recipients have adequate
    cash on hand to complete activities.

:\***Fixed Amount**

:   A fixed-amount grant provides the funder a specific level of support
    without regard to actual costs incurred by the recipient âfor
    example, a grant based on milestone (i.e., payment is based on
    completion of an activity). Following funder review of a detailed
    budget to assess the validity of proposed expenses, prices are
    assigned to each milestone or deliverable by the parties. The
    assigned prices cannot change once confirmed in the fully executed
    grant.

<!-- -->

:   This payment type is suitable for short-term projects with
    well-defined scopes. Accountability is primarily based on
    performance and results.

### Contracts

A contract is a legal instrument to acquire goods or services for the
funderâs direct benefit or use.

The purpose of a contract is the exchange of funds for good or services.
The relationship between entities is defined by procurement, with the
funder as a buyer and vendor as a seller; furthermore, it is directive
and transactional. The contractorâs primary responsibility is to satisfy
the funder.

#### Contract Payment Types {#contract_payment_types}

:\***Cost Reimbursement**

:   A cost reimbursable (CR) contract provides payment of allowable
    incurred costs to the extent (e.g., total cost or ceiling)
    prescribed in the contract. This payment type also lends itself well
    to multi-year grants for which quick start-up is needed, but the
    scope of work for later years is not fully defined. Reconciliation
    of costs via financial reporting also make it possible to issue
    advances (up to 20%) when needed and ensure contractors have
    adequate cash on hand to complete activities.

:\***Fixed Firm Price**

:   A fixed firm price (FFP) contract provides payment that is not
    subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractorâs cost
    experience in performing the contract. Accountability is primarily
    based on performance and results. Payment is based on funder
    acceptance of the designated outputs.
