# Membership

All seats on the Peer Review Committee (PRC) are allocated to
individuals who are experts in digital health. Membership is confirmed
via membership agreements between the individual member and Digital
Square.

# Member Selection Process {#member_selection_process}

The Digital Square Contacts maintains oversight of the inclusion of new
members to the PRC. Digital Square seeks to maintain a balance of expert
peers who possess technical and implementation experience in digital
health information systems, as well as leaders in advocacy and policy in
the digital health space.

Digital Square may recruit PRC Members to ensure equity, balance, and
diversification of the PRC; however, individuals can also apply to join
the PRC. Should an individual wish to apply to be a member of the PRC,
they must complete a PRC application form, which will be reviewed in
full by the Digital Square Contacts. Applicants will be notified within
three weeks of completing the form whether they are accepted to be part
of the PRC.

For more information about how to join the PRC and to request an
application form, please contact Amanda BenDor at abendor@path.org.
