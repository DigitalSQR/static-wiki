Digital Square partners with innovators to increase the availability,
adaptability, and maturity of high-quality software, service, and
content options for countries---including health-focused, mature Digital
Public Goods. Digital Square supports global goods by:

- Administering an inclusive digital health procurement process by
  allocating global goods investments transparently and with community
  input. Digital Square makes investments in global goods primarily via
  the Open Application Process, which is an innovative procurement
  solution that fosters collaboration and agility.

- Managing an active community of global goods partners. The global
  goods community allows partners to connect and learn from each other's
  best practices, in turn improving the interoperability of software.
  The community participates in monthly webinars, contributes to
  quarterly newsletters, co-creates publications, and participates in
  our annual Global Good Innovators meeting.

- Coordinating with stakeholders on digital public goods alignment.
  Digital Square is closely coordinating with the Digital Public Goods
  Alliance (DPGA) and use of global goods for specific health vertical
  use cases through the WHO Clearinghouse. These efforts will enable
  countries and investors to increase confidence in the specific digital
  tools to be prioritized for scale and adaptation in countries. Through
  this engagement, Digital Square will refresh its prioritization
  framework and Open Application Process to align more closely with
  tools formally vetted through the DPGA.
