OpenCRVS is open-source software solution for civil registration
designed specifically for use in low resource contexts.

### Approach

The core function of OpenCRVS is to formally record the occurrence and
characteristics of all vital events. It does this through a process of
notification (from the health facility), declaration of the vital event
by the informant, validation of the submitted data with supporting
documentation, registering the event and issuing a certificate (e.g.,
birth certificate) by authorized actors. The system also allows the
export of vital statistics data for further analysis and the compilation
of statistical reports e.g., disaggregated by age, sex and location. Of
specific interest to health are the registration of birth and death,
including the manner and cause of death.
