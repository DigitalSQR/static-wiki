Digital Square will pursue a competitive procurement process to
facilitate investment in global goods. A competitive process provides
capable entities the opportunity to submit bids in a fair and
transparent process for a committee to evaluate bids and to select the
successful applicant(s). In order to foster competition in alignment
with funder expectations, Digital Square will release solicitations
through the following methods.

:   1\. Open Application Process (OAP) Solicitation, referred to as a
    Notice.
:   2\. Request for Application (RFA).

The investment decision may be made by the Governing Board or funder
prior to the solicitation and will depend on:

:   A. Whether the funder decides to maintain or relinquish the
    investment decision to the Governing Board.
:   B. Whether the funder has specific business requirements attached to
    the funding opportunity. This may include the time frames for which
    funding is available or the need to coordinate with other
    investments.

For more information on the overall process for selected applicants,
please review the [Global Good Investment
Process](Global_Good_Investment_Process "Global Good Investment Process"){.wikilink}.

  Step 1: Solicitation preparation                           Digital Square works with the funder to secure investment and refine the scope of work for the solicitation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  Step 2: Concept note development                           Digital Square issues a call for applications, and applicants upload concept notes to Digital Square\'s public-facing OAP platform. In the first 2 to 4 weeks, as outlined by the solicitation, applicants will submit concept notes. Applicants must use the concept note template.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \| 2 weeks
  Step 3: Concept note review                                In the few weeks following the concept note submission deadline, other applicants and/or other stakeholders in the community may provide feedback, comments, and suggestions, as well as identify potential areas for collaboration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              3 weeks
  Step 4: Digital Square review of concept notes             Following the concept note review, Digital Square assesses concept notes to ensure alignment with the initiative vision and funding round objectives identified in the Notice. Digital Square eliminates concept notes that are not strategically aligned with the above. Digital Square identifies a set of short-listed concept notes based on the Notice criteria and emails applicants who are eligible to move on to the application phase.                                                                                                                                                                  \| 1 week
  Step 5: Preliminary technical application co-creation      Using feedback received in the Concept Note Phase, applicants will begin preliminary application development. Applicants must use the technical application template and post an application iteration on the OAP platform in the first 2 weeks. The comment feature is available beginning the day of application posting. The subsequent 2 weeks of this step, the applicant should continue to iterate on the application submission based on comments from other applicants and stakeholders. At the conclusion of this step, Digital Square will close the ability to upload new content to OAP platform .   \| 4 weeks
  Step 6: Preliminary technical application comment period   Following preliminary application development step, Digital Square will close the ability to upload content to the OAP platform. During this time, other applicants and other stakeholders in the community should provide feedback, comments, and suggestions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \| 2 weeks
