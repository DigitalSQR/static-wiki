## Shelf Readiness & Maturity Model {#shelf_readiness_maturity_model}

The term \"shelf readiness\" stems from the need to ensure that digital
health global goods, particularly software, are ready to be deployed as
stand-alone products which meet the primary data use needs of a tool.
Shelf readiness aims to allow implementers and decision makers to have a
higher level of confidence in the solutions as they would be well
presented in their product information, ability to perform desired
functions as well as interoperability workflows / metadata
synchronizations and deployment aspects, to name a few areas.

Digital Square funds a maturity model baseline assessments and
reassessments of global goods
