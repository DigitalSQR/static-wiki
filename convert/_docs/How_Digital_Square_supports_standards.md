Standards for Health Information Exchange

Digital health technology is at the core of modern, equitable health
care systems. When designed and employed effectively, systems can
seamlessly exchange information, leading to improved clinical decisions
and outcomes, care coordination, and operational efficiency. This
interoperability is made possible through health data standards for
digital technologies, which ensure data is uniformly and efficiently
exchanged across systems. Digital Square supports the global digital
health community, including country governments, in understanding,
aligning, and applying these standards. **Creating interoperable systems
prepared to swiftly advance digital health transformation**

Interoperable software enables different systems to speak the same
language, regardless of differences in interfaces, platforms, and
technologies. A suite of interoperable information systems can track and
communicate varied data such as staff availability, number of supplies
or equipment, or patient health records.

This smooth data exchange is possible because the software exists in an
integrated digital ecosystem that adheres to a common set of standards
rather than in data silos. According to [Health Level Seven
International (HL7)](https://www.hl7.org/), a nonprofit standards
development organization, software standards act as "a set of rules that
allow information to be shared in a uniform and consistent manner across
any application." Interoperability based on standards enables not only
faster implementation but also higher-quality data and improved
maintainability, thus positively impacting healthcare workers' and
patients' lives

Investing in standards development, adoption, and dissemination is key
for having interoperable systems. This investment is [recognized as
essential](https://www.oecd.org/development-cooperation-learning/practices/usaid-promotes-co-ordinated-investments-in-digital-systems-for-better-health-outcomes-e424b58b/)
to the delivery of public services by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) and is integral to the [World Health
Organization's (WHO's) digital health
strategy](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/gs4dhdaa2a9f352b0445bafbc79ca799dce4d.pdf?sfvrsn=f112ede5_48).
Standards investments also lead to a wide range of improvements. As
government and facility workforces adopt and become familiar with these
systems, digital tools can generate the following benefits to advance
health outcomes:

- Facilitate operational ease and efficiency for policymakers, health
  workers, and facility managers.
- Create new opportunities for data sharing, visualization, and
  analytics to enable quicker decision-making.
- Reduce the time and cost of troubleshooting information technology
  (IT) and operational problems such as managing stockouts, conducting
  data entry, and implementing digital workarounds.
- Reuse existing work and lower the cost of the development of new
  features and software among users, increasing efficiencies in the
  health system.
- Provide the basis for systems and people to collaborate so the focus
  can be on the health and well-being of patients.

By establishing a common foundation and set of tools, software can rely
on consistent input from other systems, creating space for stakeholders
to swiftly propel digital innovations forward while focusing on what
counts: the provision and management of health care.

**Engaging with countries and the broader global goods community to
support the development of and adherence to standards**
