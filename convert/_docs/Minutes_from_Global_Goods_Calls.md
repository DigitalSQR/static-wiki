## January 3, 2018 Call \| Update on Peer Review Process {#january_3_2018_call_update_on_peer_review_process}

- Welcome â Lauren Wall
- Why Digital Square updated the open proposals process â Carl Leitner
  - We took feedback from the previous round of global goods
    submissions, Notice A. Thanks to that feedback we have designed a
    round that will provide more time for proposal development, provide
    feedback earlier, and identify potential duplicative work earlier.
- Digital Square prioritization
  - Digital Squareâs Governing Board is currently developing a
    prioritization framework for global goods investments. We will share
    this if it is finalized for Notice B.
- Open Proposals Process:
  - We are hosting this process online at:
    <https://open-proposals.ucsf.edu/digital-square/notice-b>
  - You must request an account. You will be approved \~ 24 business
    hours.
  - Please provide feedback on concept notes and proposals, as well.

We will use the following schedule

We are currently in the concept notes phase. The concept note phase is
detailed on the site when you click âAdd your proposalâ. It requests
three pieces of information:

1.  Executive summaryâDescribe in two to three paragraphs, for a
    non-technical audience, the context under which this proposal or
    work plan is being submitted to the Digital Square and the expected
    outcomes.
2.  Consortium teamâDescribe in brief, the composition of the
    consortium, the skill sets each organization will bring to bear on
    the proposal or work plan. Identify the organizational management
    lead who will serve as the point of contact for the proposal or work
    plan. You can also indicate that you are looking for collaborators
    during the Concept Note phase.
3.  Project descriptionâProvide a few paragraphs describing the
    project/proposal/idea.

Q&A The open proposals process:

- How can we complete self-assessments on the Global Goods Maturity
  Model? You can make a copy of the Google sheet and submit with a link
  or as an Excel document.
- Where can I find the Global Goods Maturity Model? Here. It is also
  accessible through our Wiki.
- How do I provide feedback on concept notes? Digital Square uses an
  open proposal process. You can create an account and provide comments
  and feedback on the posted proposals.
- Will my concept note and proposal get feedback? Digital Square cannot
  control the amount of feedback provided by other submitters. Digital
  Square does strive, however, to provide a minimum amount of feedback
  from the Peer Review Committee.
- What happens if my concept note or proposal receives conflicting
  feedback? Digital Square has no control over crowdsourced comments. In
  the event of conflicting comments, Digital Square can assist
  submitters choose the best way to proceed.
- What level of budget detail should be included in proposal budgets?
  The Governing Board should have an idea of how funding will be spent.
  The budget should be a line item budget that includes activities,
  travel, staffing, and LOE.
- Do all submitted concept notes progress to the proposal phase? Digital
  Square will not prevent the advancement of any concept notes into
  proposal phase unless they are clearly out of Digital Squareâs scope.
- Can my organization submit more than one concept note or proposal?
  Yes.
- What visibility do other submitters have into my concept note? All
  concept notes and proposals can be viewed by all other submitters.
  Digital Square encourages submitters to provide feedback on other
  concept notes and proposals and look for potential collaborators.
  Other submitters will not see any budget information. The PRC will see
  high-level budget and LOE only.
