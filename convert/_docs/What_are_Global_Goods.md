Digital Square supports [
investments](Digital_Square_Investments_in_Global_Goods " investments"){.wikilink}
into various digital health tools which are [Global
Goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_public_good).

Digital health tools which are global goods are software that is
(usually) Free and Open Source
([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)),
supported by a strong community, has a clear governance structure,
funded by multiple sources, deployed at significant scale, used in
multiple countries, has demonstrated effectiveness, is designed to be
interoperable and is an emergent standard application.

To help identify areas of investments for global goods, Digital Square
is developing a [Global Good Maturity
Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16nZHBsb6Zjsh9T_7Fj7zvMXUspjh39CNSS76UT6WHJU/edit#gid=0)
for digital health tools. We have engaged the digital health community
in the development of this model, in particular the [Digital Health and
Interoperability Working
Group](https://www.healthdatacollaborative.org/how-we-work/digital-health-interoperability-working-group/)
of the [Health Data
Collaborative](https://www.healthdatacollaborative.org/).

Currently, the maturity model is in draft (beta) form and a release
candidate will be presented at the Global Digital Health Forum.
