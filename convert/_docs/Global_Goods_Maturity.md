## Maturity Model {#maturity_model}

To help identify areas of investments for global goods, Digital Square
is developing a [Global Good Maturity
Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16nZHBsb6Zjsh9T_7Fj7zvMXUspjh39CNSS76UT6WHJU/edit#gid=0)
for digital health tools. We have engaged the digital health community,
in particular the [Digital Health and Interoperability Working
Group](https://www.healthdatacollaborative.org/how-we-work/digital-health-interoperability-working-group/)
of the [Health Data
Collaborative](https://www.healthdatacollaborative.org/), in the
development of this model.

Currently, the maturity model is in version 1.1 form and a release
candidate was presented at the [Global Digital Health
Forum](https://www.mhealthworkinggroup.org/content/global-digital-health-forum-2017)
in December of 2017.
