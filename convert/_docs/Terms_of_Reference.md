The promise of digital health has not been fully realized and efforts to
scale programs and technologies have largely been unsuccessful. The
three core barriers to maximizing the potential of digital technologies
to improve health outcomes are: lack of coordinated funding aligned to
government priorities; lack of support for, and use of, existing
open-source technologies (âglobal goodsâ) that could be reused or
adapted; and lack of regional leadership and capacity.

Digital Square is a new way to do development. Our approach is to tackle
the barriers that prevent digital technologies and systems from scaling.
Digital Square\'s aim is that countries are empowered to develop
sustainable national digital infrastructures, supported by coordinated
investments, so that governments and decision- makers can access the
information they need, when they need it, to ensure better health data
and health outcomes for all. In order to achieve this vision, Digital
Square will conduct activities to: â¢ Improve coordination of investors.
â¢ Increase alignment and coordination in the digital health community.
â¢ Increase adoption and reuse of digital health global goods. â¢
Enhance leadership capacity in low- and middle-income countries for
managing regional and country digital health systems.

The following are the Terms of Reference for the Digital Square
[Governing Board](Governing_Board "Governing Board"){.wikilink}.

## Purpose of the Governing Board {#purpose_of_the_governing_board}

The purpose of the Governing Board (the âBoardâ) is to: â¢ Make final
decisions about Opal investments based on the Opal management teamâs
recommendations. â¢ Guide and advise the Opal management team in
managing Opalâs work. â¢ Seek and help secure additional resources for
Opal. 2.0. Responsibilities The responsibilities of the Board are to: â¢
Establish and carry out an effective system of governance at the board
level. â¢ Advocate and promote Opalâs work with other global initiatives
at regional and national levels, including within their own
organizations. â¢ Support fundraising by actively prioritizing and
lobbying for strategic awards to ensure operational viability and
strategic growth. â¢ Make decisions about the investments of Opal based
on recommendations from the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and Opal
management team. â¢ Provide oversight to the strategic direction of
Opal, as well as advise on and approve major strategic changes. â¢
Support Opal in acquiring the necessary resources to accomplish its
objectives. â¢ Provide oversight of the TAG. â¢ Individual Board Members
may be called upon for their expertise in specific issues. 3.0.
Expectations of Board Members In addition to the above responsibilities,
Opal envisions that the Board Members will engage in the realization of
Opalâs strategy through the following two venues: â¢ Ambassadors of
Opal: Alignment within the donor and digital health communitiesâas well
as key leaders in non-health sectorsâis crucial to the success of Opal.
Board Members should actively advocate with the organizations, networks,
and industries of which they are members in order to align with the
mission and activities of Opal. This can include financial and in-kind
contributions, partnerships on events and awareness-raising efforts, and
ensuring that Opalâs work, including the global goods, is on global
agendas for the next era in digital health and development. â¢
Fundraising: Board Members have a responsibility to ensure that Opal
stays on its financial trajectory. Board Members should support the
financial sustainability of Opal by proactively engaging in fundraising
efforts and using connections with their various networks to garner
additional financial support for Opal. 4.0. Benefits of Board membership
By virtue of the Boardâs leadership role in shaping the future of
digital health, Opal Board Members will benefit from: â¢ A voice in
identifying and prioritizing Opalâs global strategic investment. â¢ A
vote in Board investment decisions. â¢ Access to a new network of
thought leaders in digital health. 5.0. Composition The Board is the
governing body of Opal and is dedicated to advancing the mission, goals,
and priorities of Opal. The Board will consist of 13 Members plus a
non-voting Chair. Seats will be filled by both individuals and
organizations. Organizations will assign one Representative and may
assign one Alternate to each seat. In the event that a Board Member (or
Representative) is unable to fulfill his/her role, a new Board Member
will be selected as a replacement. Although the final composition of the
Board will be based on the quality and diversity of potential Members,
it is planned to comprise: â¢ Three to four investing donor
representatives. â¢ Three to four implementing organizations. â¢ Three
to four technical experts from the digital health product development
field. â¢ One to two globally recognized leaders who are considered to
have a key role in contributing to the longer-term vision for Opal.

PATH will act as Chair of the Board. Each Member will be allotted one
vote, except for the Chair, whose role is ex officio and does not
include voting rights. A Board Member who does not fulfill his/her
responsibilities or misses two meetings without reasonable explanation
will be asked by the Chair to resign. If the Board Member refuses to
resign, a vote will be taken on the removal of the Member from the
Board. 6.0. Meetings There will be three Board meetings each year.
Following the first formal meeting of the Board, subsequent meetings
will be convened every four months. Two meetings will be virtual (phone)
with optional in-person attendance. There will be one in-person meeting
each year, likely to be in Washington, DC; London; Seattle; or New York.
Board Members are expected to participate in all meetings. In addition
to the three annual Board meetings, three reading days are anticipated.
Ad hoc conference calls and/or meetings may also be called by the Chair
of the Board if necessary to discuss specific issues. 7.0. Term Board
membership term will be two years, with recruitment taking place over
the course of the first year, in order to stagger Board Member elections
and to balance this with the need for continuity in leadership. Seats
held by organizations may change their individual Representative at
midterm at their own discretion; however, the organization is required
to notify the Chair of any such change at least four weeks in advance of
the next Board meeting. 8.0. Chair PATH will act as Chair of the Board.
Each Member will be allotted one vote, except for the Chair, whose role
is ex officio and does not include voting rights. The Chair will: â¢
Convene and preside over each Board meeting, including approving the
agenda and decision points that Board members make. â¢ Foster and guide
consensus-based decision-making by the Board. â¢ Provide due diligence
on the Board membership, including ensuring that the overall composition
of the Board remains balanced and effective and that Members remain
appropriately engaged and are reviewing notifications on breaches of
conflict of interest. â¢ Serve as one of the principal spokespersons for
Opal, along with Opalâs Director. â¢ Provide guidance to the Director of
Opal on an as-needed basis, including guidance on bringing issues to the
attention of the Board for input or decision. 9.0. Voting Quorum will be
two-thirds of the Board. All Board Members, except for the nonvoting
Chair, have one vote, and all votes are weighted equally. Decisions not
reached through consensus will be approved with a majority of present
members. Board Members may vote by proxy via their Alternate. For votes
on investments, the Opal management team will compile recommendations
from Opalâs Peer Review Committee and submit these recommendations to
the Board. This investment decision-making process will be vetted and
approved by the Board in year 1. 10.0. Committees Board committees will
be established as required and if approved by a majority of the Board
members. The Opal management team will be responsible for coordinating
such committees and providing reports on committee activities back to
the Board. 11.0. Conflict of interest Regarding potential conflicts of
interest, a Conflict of Interest and strong recusal and transparent
Recusal Policy is in place to maintain the objectivity of the Board and
all of its Members, including the Chair. 12.0. Contact Lesley-Anne Long

Members will be chosen both for their individual expertise and
leadership qualities and for their ability to represent the interests of
stakeholders. For this reason, should a Member change organizational
affiliation or shift positions or portfolios within his/her
organization, the Board Chair has the right to ask for that Memberâs
resignation in order to maintain the intended balance of representation
on the Board. 5.2. Member OrganizationsâFor seats filled by
organizations, the organization will be responsible for appointing an

discretion; however, the Member Organization is required to notify the
Board Chair at least four weeks in advance. 5.3. Individual MembersâIf a
Member is an individual, he/she may appoint a proxy, approved by the
Chair and the Director. Individual Members should complete terms of two
years, but if they must leave the Board, they are required to notify the
Board Chair at least four weeks in advance. 5.4. Individual Member

and leadership qualities and for their ability to represent the
interests of stakeholders. For this reason, should an Individual Member

Conflict of Interest and Recusal Policy 1.0. Purpose 1.1. Conflicts of
interestâof varying degrees of significance or natureâmay arise in the
conduct of Opalâs operations. A conflict of interest in and of itself is
not wrong and may not be unethical, but those involved in
decision-making processes on behalf of Opal must take appropriate action
to ensure disclosure of any actual, perceived, or potential conflicts of
interest. As a result, Opal will be able to properly manage conflicts of
interest and thus mitigate the operational and reputational risks
inherent in such conflicts. 1.2. The purpose of this Conflict of
Interest and Recusal Policy (this âPolicyâ) is therefore to protect the
integrity and reputation of Opalâs decision-making processes,
particularly in regard to the allocation and disbursement of resources,
by establishing procedures to identify, evaluate, and address any
actual, perceived, or potential conflicts that may arise. As a basic
principle, such conflicts must be resolved in favor of Opal. Those
involved in decision-making processes on behalf of Opal will be expected
to abide by the provisions of this Policy. 2.0. Definitions 2.1. Board
Member(s)âAny member of the Governing Board (the âBoardâ) (including
alternate Board Members). 2.2. Family member(s)âA Board Memberâs
grandparents, parents/guardians, spouse/domestic partner, siblings,
children/dependents, and/or grandchildren. 2.3. Conflict of interestâA
situation where a Board Member has an actual, perceived, or potential
organizational or financial/personal interest, as defined below, that
may: â¢ Affect the conduct of his/her duties and responsibilities with
respect to Opal. â¢ Create the perception that the Board Member is using
his/her position in Opal for organizational or personal financial gain
at the expense of Opal. 2.4. Organizational interestâAn organizational
interest arises when a Board Member is an officer, director, trustee,
partner, or (negotiating to become) an employee of an entity that may
benefit financially from a decision on which he/she would vote. 2.5.
Financial/personal interestâA Board Member has a financial/personal
interest when he/she or any family member may benefit financially or in
any other significant way from a transaction or other financial
arrangement between the initiative and an entity with which the Board
Member has: â¢ An ownership or investment interest. â¢ A senior
leadership or board member position (whether paid or unpaid). â¢ A
direct or indirect compensation arrangement, including through a
business, investment, or family member, or in the form of substantial
gifts or favors. â¢ A potential in securing any of the above. 3.0.
Conflict of interest established Members of the Board will not use their
position of influence to secure any financial gain for themselves, their
family members, or the organizations with which they are affiliated.
There are several possibilities for determining whether an actual,
perceived, or potential conflict exists: â¢ A Board Member discloses
that he/she has an actual, perceived, or potential conflict. â¢ The
Chair determines an actual, perceived, or potential conflict exists. â¢
The Board determines an actual, perceived, or potential conflict exists.
â¢ The Peer Review Committee determines an actual, perceived, or
potential conflict exists. 4.0. Categories of interest Interests can
generally be categorized according to the following types: â¢ Direct: A
direct interest in any Board decision, policy, or contract may be
established when a Board Member directly benefits from such decision,
policy, or contract through an organizational or personal/financial
interest. â¢ Indirect: An indirect interest in any Board decision,
policy, or contract may be established when a Board Member indirectly
benefits from such decision, policy, or contract through an
organizational or financial/personal interest. 5.0. Duty to disclose
5.1. A Board Member must disclose organizational and/or
financial/personal interests and the nature of such interest when he/she
becomes aware that a conflict exists, could be perceived to exist, or is
likely to occur. Such risks should be disclosed in writing to the Chair
and Director upon joining the Board (for preexisting conflicts), within
one week of the Board Member being notified of the conflict of interest
or before the next Board meeting, whichever comes first. 6.0. Recusal
6.1. Though Board Members bring their experience and affiliations to
bear for the benefit of Opal, they should also recognize their fiduciary
responsibility to put the interests of Opal before other interests when
taking decisions on behalf of Opal. Concurrently, when discharging their
duties, Board Members who represent organizations are not required to
make decisions that conflict with the constitution, regulations, rules,
and policies of the organization providing that Member to the Board.
Therefore, participation in and disclosure of any actual, perceived, or
potential conflict of interest relevant to a Board decision should be
guided by the provisions of this Policy, with any such conflict
identified and declared. 6.2. During the course of a Board meeting, a
Board Member with an actual, perceived, or potential conflict of
interest shall disclose the conflict to the Chair as soon as possible
upon learning of the possible conflict of interest and in no event later
than at the beginning of discussion of the pertinent agenda item. 6.3.
It shall be the decision of the Chair, in consultation with the
Director, to determine the scope and level of a conflicted Board
Memberâs participation in the discussion and the necessity of recusal
from deliberation, motions, and voting given the type of interest
disclosed. The minutes of the meeting shall reflect the conflicted
Memberâs disclosure and whether the conflicted Member participated in
the discussion and/or abstained from voting. 7.0. Failure to disclose
7.1. Should any Board Member have reasonable cause to believe that
another Board Member has failed to disclose an actual, perceived, or
potential conflict of interest, he/she shall inform the Chair and the
Director. The Board Member shall have an opportunity to explain the
alleged failure to disclose. The reporting Board Member should have
reasonable grounds for suspecting a violation and must do so in good
faith. Knowingly reporting false or frivolous information is contrary to
this Policy. 7.2. Failure to disclose or disputes over whether a
conflict exists may be referred to the Board for resolution. Failure to
disclose a personal interest by a Board Member who represents an
organization shall be addressed in consultation with the organization
providing that Member. 8.0. Contact Lesley-Anne Long Director, Opal,
