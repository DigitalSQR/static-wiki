## Introduction

The Digital Health & Interoperability Working Group (DH&I WG) is a
volunteer community of practice dedicated to strengthening country
health systems and outcomes through the appropriate and responsible use
of digital information technologies. Its membership comprises over 250
individuals from governments, donors, multilateral organizations,
academia, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
The Working Group meets monthly by phone, and annually in person
alongside the Global Digital Health Forum. It is co-chaired by USAID,
WHO, and the Regenstrief Institute, with Digital Square providing
Secretariat support, which includes hosting this wiki.

## Objectives

1.  Optimize the meaningful use and reuse of health information
    technology in low- and middle-income countries to support
    achievement of SDGs through the implementation of foundational
    digital health infrastructures;
2.  Actively promote the development, use, and long-term support of
    digital health âglobal public goodsâ; and
3.  Increase, in a measurable way, the level and alignment of country
    and partner investments in support of Objectives 1 and 2.

## Shared Values {#shared_values}

#### Open

We are open, honest, and actively transparent in both our processes and
our work together.

We believe itâs important to publicly document and share our knowledge,
skills, experiences, and failures.

We endorse and support the use of open health information standards, and
work to apply them usefully within resource-constrained environments.

#### User-Centered {#user_centered}

We respond to specific country and stakeholder demands, not our
imagination.

We design highly adaptable processes and technologies to work in the
most challenging environments.

We believe in upfront planning for sustainability.

#### Collaborative

We work collectively to prioritize and address the real-world needs of
our workgroup participants.

We believe in the power of community, as the best ideas come from people
with different backgrounds and talents.

We believe in harnessing the wisdom of our workgroup by creating a safe
place to raise concerns, discuss failures, improve existing ideas, and
solve problems.

## Origins

The Digital Health & Interoperability Working Group is an independent
community of practice forged among some of the world\'s leading digital
health experts. It formalized in 2014 alongside USAIDâs Ebola Broad
Agency Announcement to facilitate collaboration among digital health
responders to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. In 2016, the Working
Group formed an affiliation with the Health Data Collaborative. Since
2016, the group has grown to more than 250 members representing more
than 100 organizations, governments, and multilateral and bilateral
donors.

## Small Working Groups {#small_working_groups}

The DH&I Working Group forms small working groups that focus on areas of
work that build consensus and coordinate in the development and use of
tools in the digital health sector. There are currently seven small
working groups under the DH&I Working Group:

- Maturity models
- Digital health curriculum
- Private sector engagement
- Health apps for all
- Digital health, AI, and frontier technologies for Universal Health
  Coverage
- Digital health key terms and theory of change
- Architecture, standards, and knowledge

## Tools

The Digital Health & Interoperability Working Group has leveraged its
platform for collective action to develop and/or contribute to the
development of tools that respond to common country-identified health
sector needs. These tools can be grouped into the following categories:

### Terminology and classification {#terminology_and_classification}

Standardizing the way we identify and describe digital health
interventions and make evidence-based recommendations.

- [WHO Classifications of Digital Health
  Interventions](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/mhealth/classification-digital-health-interventions/en/)
- [WHO Guideline on Digital Interventions for Health Systems
  Strengthening](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/digital-interventions-health-system-strengthening/en/)

### Maturity assessments {#maturity_assessments}

Standardizing the way we assess countriesâ digital health ecosystems,
tools in use, and HIS digitization readiness, including for
interoperability.

- [WHO Digital Health Atlas](https://digitalhealthatlas.org/)
- [Global Digital Health Index](http://index.digitalhealthindex.org/map)
- [HIS Interoperability Maturity
  Toolkit](https://www.measureevaluation.org/his-strengthening-resource-center/his-stages-of-continuous-improvement-toolkit)
- [HIS Stages of Continuous Improvement
  Toolkit](https://www.measureevaluation.org/his-strengthening-resource-center/his-stages-of-continuous-improvement-toolkit)

### Investment and valuation tools {#investment_and_valuation_tools}

Inform the way investments in digital systems are planned, and the
valuation of software global goods is determined.

- Forthcoming: Software Global Goods: A Financial Valuation Framework
- [Digital Health Investment Review
  Tool](https://www.mcsprogram.org/resource/digital-health-investment-review-tool/)
- [Global Goods Maturity
  Model](https://wiki.digitalsquare.io/index.php/What_are_Global_Goods#Maturity_Model)

### Curricula development {#curricula_development}

Building common pedagogical approaches to building capacity in the use
of these and other digital health resources.

- Digital Health 101 for Policy Makers (under development)
- Introduction to Digital Health for Donors and other Funding Partners
  (under development)
- Digital Health Leadership Program (under development)

## Community Alignment {#community_alignment}

The DH&I WG is proud to collaborate actively with other regional and
thematic networks contributing to the strategic use of digital
technologies in low-resource and emerging market settings. These include
the:

- [Asian eHealth Information Network (AeHIN)](http://www.aehin.org/)
- [African Alliance of Digital Health
  Networks](https://www.africanalliance.digital/)
- [Global Digital Health
  Network](https://www.globaldigitalhealthnetwork.org/)
