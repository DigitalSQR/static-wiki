# COVID-19 Community Coordination {#covid_19_community_coordination}

Digital Square is pleased to share resources sourced from the Digital
Health Community to facilitate alignment and coordination in the
COVID-19 response, and to support countries choosing digital tools to
aid in their own response efforts. If you have a resource you would like
us to host on the wiki, please contact [Amanda
BenDor](mailto:abendor@path.org).

### UNICEF Country Mapping for COVID-19 Response {#unicef_country_mapping_for_covid_19_response}

UNICEF has initiated a **country mapping** of relevant Digital Health
solutions that can be leveraged to support frontline health workers in
their response to COVID-19 and that can be used by countries to support
Risk Communication and Community Engagement on COVID-19. The mapping can
be accessed
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GbM1nuHxnCvoc1hLLcQAt7QOoQxnAXdI3hdP3Qt7KUg/edit?usp=sharing).
If you want to update the country mapping, please use the comment
function and the UNICEF team will update the information accordingly.

Likewise, a **partnership landscaping** has also been done to map where
implementing partners are working to support digital tools for frontline
health workers and which digital solutions they are supporting. This
mapping can be accessed
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y6fl3Uqvn0lcFhBlYPXLKKi2HXi79kw8pWR_h8PwE3s/edit?usp=sharing).
If your organization is missing from the partnership landscaping, you
can add the information directly in the spread sheet.

Both these mapping tools are free to use by anyone who wish to know
which solutions already exist at country level and that can be deployed
for frontline health workers for COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.

# Comparison of Digital Tools used in the COVID-19 Response {#comparison_of_digital_tools_used_in_the_covid_19_response}

Countries have access to a large, complex ecosystem of digital platforms
that can support COVID-19 response. The process of selecting the most
appropriate platform for a country\'s specific needs or context can be
overwhelming without clear information about the benefits and
limitations of the options. Several new resources have been developed to
support in-country assessment and decisions about digital technologies
for COVID response.

### Johns Hopkins assessment {#johns_hopkins_assessment}

In July 2020, Johns Hopkins published an assessment of digital platforms
that have an established presence in several low- and middle-income
countries (LMIC), and either have been or could be rapidly reconfigured
to address COVID-19 related case management and contact tracing needs.
The assessment includes a review of the following tools: CommCare,
Community Health Toolkit (CHT), DHIS2 Tracker, Go.Data, ODK, OpenSRP,
RapidPro, SORMAS, and WelTel. The platforms were selected based on their
existing deployment, flexibility, and adaptability for COVID-19 use
cases, their ability to support multiple languages, and stakeholder
interest in how these applications can be leveraged in response to
COVID-19. The full report can be accessed
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yCP7t1di_ofQ0YhuPAD1Oqcj1aTo74k5/view).

### Digital Square efforts {#digital_square_efforts}

In recognition that this is a rapidly evolving landscape, Digital Square
has been working across donors to collate a comparison of digital tools
that are currently used in the COVID-19 response. Included in the
comparison is an analysis of a number of functional and non-functional
requirements. Including in this document are the following digital
health tools: DHIS2, SORMAS, Go.Data, EpiInfo, CommCare, ODK, Kobo
Toolbox, Excel and non-digital paper tools. This comparison is a dynamic
document meant for community updates that can be accessed
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cMQAZO94uTe4HULLmBRN80fPnNUwayqw3e2UT-voJbw/edit?usp=sharing).
If you would like to make updates including adding additional tools or
information to tools included, please contact [Carl
Fourie](mailto:cfourie@path.org).

#### Map & Match {#map_match}

The USAID-funded Map & Match project helps countries, donors,
implementing partners, and the global digital health community at large
to leverage and adapt existing digital tools in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. As the world learned during the West Africa Ebola outbreak
response, prioritizing the reuse and adaptation of existing digital
tools is vital to quickly scale access to time-sensitive disease
information and data. [**Find Map & Match resources on the Digital
Square website here.**](https://digitalsquare.org/covid19-map-match)

- In March 2021, Digital Square published the [*Digital Applications and
  Tools Across an Epidemiological
  Curve*](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59bc3457ccc5c5890fe7cacd/t/603d549f3e5f2c2800651483/1614632096462/DATEC-FINAL.pdf).
  This resource provides a strategic framework for governments,
  investors, implementing organizations, and the digital health
  community to better understand how existing digital tools can be
  adapted and used during different phases of an outbreak.

# Country Support {#country_support}

## Mali

With funding from USAID Mali, Digital Square is working closely with the
Mali Ministry of Health and partners such as CDC, Gavi, UNICEF and
Global Fund to support adaptation and scale of digital health tools to
support the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. Through the end of 2021,
Digital Square is specifically supporting the following activities:

1.  Adapt and scale existing health information systems for COVID-19
    vaccine rollout to enable real-time monitoring of vaccine
    availability and vaccine coverage.
2.  Support MOH to transition existing paper-based systems to digital
    platforms (focus on digital tools for monitoring adverse side
    effects).
3.  Harness digital tools to identify and locate persons eligible for
    vaccination.
4.  Identify tools and applications to be made interoperable.
5.  Contribute to an evaluation of a vaccination campaign in Bamako.

For more information on these activities or to coordinate with the
Digital Square team, [please contact Caitlin
Bowman](mailto:cbowman@path.org).
