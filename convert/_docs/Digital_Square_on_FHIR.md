### Digital Square on FHIR {#digital_square_on_fhir}

Digital Square\'s FHIR-focused webinar series provides guidance to help
digital health developers, innovators, digital public goods and global
goods developers, and implementers better understand how to use FHIR to
address specific use cases, such as technical guidance for COVID-19
vaccination certificates. This work also increases the maturity of FHIR
through the use and feedback to HL7 through their collaborative process.

Digital Square hosts monthly webinars to enhance digital health\'s
capacity. The FHIR training material on this site is designed for
digital health leaders with some or limited prior experience and
knowledge of FHIR. All sessions are recorded and shared here.

## FHIR Foundational Series {#fhir_foundational_series}

These sessions provide a comprehensive review of the fundamentals of
FHIR, how it works, and supports interoperability in healthcare. These
sessions are helpful for beginners who want to become familiar with
FHIR. Look out for French and Spanish webinars coming soon.

### FHIR 101 Refresher {#fhir_101_refresher}

This kick-off webinar reviews the basics of FHIR, including the overall
approach, information models, and the relationship between FHIR and
other standards. It also provides key pointers for participants to seek
further information and engage with the rest of the FHIR community.

### FHIR Profiling & Documentation {#fhir_profiling_documentation}

This webinar explores the basics for creating and documenting a FHIR
specification for a project, a country, or an individual application.
Additionally, the components of a FHIR specification and how
specifications can be documented to accelerate delivery through
validation, testing, and automation. Learn how FHIR specifications can
be extended and constrained to support specific needs. Additionally,
learn some of the basic FHIR features around localization and
multi-language, which become more critical when implementing FHIR
profiles.

### FHIR and Terminology {#fhir_and_terminology}

This session introduces FHIR® support for terminologies: Standard
(global) terminologies like SNOMED CT, LOINC, or local terminologies
(for example, national codes) vs. project-specific terminologies. Learn
about FHIR resources for terminologies, how they are used in the other
FHIR resources, how to define new terminology resources, and how to
localize the value sets.

### FHIR Implementation Guide {#fhir_implementation_guide}

This is a practical workshop-like session to create a FHIR specification
publication. Using open-source tools, here is a step-by-step guide to
creating a publication of an Implementation Guide in the most
fundamental aspects: Setting up a (shared) repository, adding FHIR®
conformance resources (e.g., profiles, extensions, value sets),
importing dependencies from other specifications, adding narrative text
and diagrams, and using a shorthand language to accelerate the work. The
goal is to help you create your first FHIR Implementation Guide!
