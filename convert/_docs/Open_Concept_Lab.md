# Open Concept Lab {#open_concept_lab}

Open Concept Lab is an open-source terminology management system for the
global community.

### Approach

The Open Concept Lab (OCL) is a suite of open-source tools to manage and
use health terminologies. The OCL Terminology Service is a RESTful API
with support for FHIR based on the Sharing Valuesets and Concept Maps
(SVCM) IHE Profile. It is designed to be used in a shared, cloud-based
environment or as an architectural component within an organization data
exchange architecture. The OCL TermBrowser is the primary tool for
searching and managing content on an OCL Terminology Server, and it can
also integrate with other SVCM-compatible servers, such as HAPI FHIR.
OCL Online is the hosted instance of all OCL tools at
openconceptlab.org. that is pre-loaded key terminologies, including
ICD-10, SNOMED-GPS, LOINC, and much more. OCL Online lowers barriers to
getting started with terminology and to collaborating with the global
community.

OCL targets three user personas: 1. A Terminology Publisher manages and
publishes original terminology resources, leveraging and mapping to
reference vocabularies and other user-generated content. 2. A
Terminology Implementer adapts and repackages terminology resources from
terminology publishers, such as WHO DDCC/SMART Guidelines or CIEL, based
on local implementation needs, e.g., by adding a local dialect or
mapping to local codes. 3. A Terminology Consumer searches compares, and
exports terminology resources that are relevant to his/her project(s) to
achieve a better understanding of concepts, use the right codes, and
navigate relationships between terms.

### Implementations

OCL Online serves users across the globe, with larger ongoing or
emerging implementations in Bangladesh, Dominica, Ethiopia, Haiti,
India, Malawi, Uganda, and United States. Self-hosted implementations of
OCL include Kenya and Chile. Several organizations with global reach
also use OCL, including WHO, CDC and PEPFAR.
