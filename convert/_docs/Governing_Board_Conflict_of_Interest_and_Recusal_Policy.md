Governing Board Conflict of Interest and Recusal Policy 1.0. Purpose
1.1. Conflicts of interestâof varying degrees of significance or
natureâmay arise in the conduct of Opalâs operations. A conflict of
interest in and of itself is not wrong and may not be unethical, but
those involved in decision-making processes on behalf of Opal must take
appropriate action to ensure disclosure of any actual, perceived, or
potential conflicts of interest. As a result, Opal will be able to
properly manage conflicts of interest and thus mitigate the operational
and reputational risks inherent in such conflicts. 1.2. The purpose of
this Conflict of Interest and Recusal Policy (this âPolicyâ) is
therefore to protect the integrity and reputation of Opalâs
decision-making processes, particularly in regard to the allocation and
disbursement of resources, by establishing procedures to identify,
evaluate, and address any actual, perceived, or potential conflicts that
may arise. As a basic principle, such conflicts must be resolved in
favor of Opal. Those involved in decision-making processes on behalf of
Opal will be expected to abide by the provisions of this Policy. 2.0.
Definitions 2.1. Board Member(s)âAny member of the Governing Board (the
âBoardâ) (including alternate Board Members). 2.2. Family member(s)âA
Board Memberâs grandparents, parents/guardians, spouse/domestic partner,
siblings, children/dependents, and/or grandchildren. 2.3. Conflict of
interestâA situation where a Board Member has an actual, perceived, or
potential organizational or financial/personal interest, as defined
below, that may: â¢ Affect the conduct of his/her duties and
responsibilities with respect to Opal. â¢ Create the perception that the
Board Member is using his/her position in Opal for organizational or
personal financial gain at the expense of Opal. 2.4. Organizational
interestâAn organizational interest arises when a Board Member is an
officer, director, trustee, partner, or (negotiating to become) an
employee of an entity that may benefit financially from a decision on
which he/she would vote. 2.5. Financial/personal interestâA Board Member
has a financial/personal interest when he/she or any family member may
benefit financially or in any other significant way from a transaction
or other financial arrangement between the initiative and an entity with
which the Board Member has: â¢ An ownership or investment interest. â¢ A
senior leadership or board member position (whether paid or unpaid). â¢
A direct or indirect compensation arrangement, including through a
business, investment, or family member, or in the form of substantial
gifts or favors. â¢ A potential in securing any of the above. 3.0.
Conflict of interest established Members of the Board will not use their
position of influence to secure any financial gain for themselves, their
family members, or the organizations with which they are affiliated.
There are several possibilities for determining whether an actual,
perceived, or potential conflict exists: â¢ A Board Member discloses
that he/she has an actual, perceived, or potential conflict. â¢ The
Chair determines an actual, perceived, or potential conflict exists. â¢
The Board determines an actual, perceived, or potential conflict exists.
â¢ The Peer Review Committee determines an actual, perceived, or
potential conflict exists. 4.0. Categories of interest Interests can
generally be categorized according to the following types: â¢ Direct: A
direct interest in any Board decision, policy, or contract may be
established when a Board Member directly benefits from such decision,
policy, or contract through an organizational or personal/financial
interest. â¢ Indirect: An indirect interest in any Board decision,
policy, or contract may be established when a Board Member indirectly
benefits from such decision, policy, or contract through an
organizational or financial/personal interest. 5.0. Duty to disclose
5.1. A Board Member must disclose organizational and/or
financial/personal interests and the nature of such interest when he/she
becomes aware that a conflict exists, could be perceived to exist, or is
likely to occur. Such risks should be disclosed in writing to the Chair
and Director upon joining the Board (for preexisting conflicts), within
one week of the Board Member being notified of the conflict of interest
or before the next Board meeting, whichever comes first. 6.0. Recusal
6.1. Though Board Members bring their experience and affiliations to
bear for the benefit of Opal, they should also recognize their fiduciary
responsibility to put the interests of Opal before other interests when
taking decisions on behalf of Opal. Concurrently, when discharging their
duties, Board Members who represent organizations are not required to
make decisions that conflict with the constitution, regulations, rules,
and policies of the organization providing that Member to the Board.
Therefore, participation in and disclosure of any actual, perceived, or
potential conflict of interest relevant to a Board decision should be
guided by the provisions of this Policy, with any such conflict
identified and declared. 6.2. During the course of a Board meeting, a
Board Member with an actual, perceived, or potential conflict of
interest shall disclose the conflict to the Chair as soon as possible
upon learning of the possible conflict of interest and in no event later
than at the beginning of discussion of the pertinent agenda item. 6.3.
It shall be the decision of the Chair, in consultation with the
Director, to determine the scope and level of a conflicted Board
Memberâs participation in the discussion and the necessity of recusal
from deliberation, motions, and voting given the type of interest
disclosed. The minutes of the meeting shall reflect the conflicted
Memberâs disclosure and whether the conflicted Member participated in
the discussion and/or abstained from voting. 7.0. Failure to disclose
7.1. Should any Board Member have reasonable cause to believe that
another Board Member has failed to disclose an actual, perceived, or
potential conflict of interest, he/she shall inform the Chair and the
Director. The Board Member shall have an opportunity to explain the
alleged failure to disclose. The reporting Board Member should have
reasonable grounds for suspecting a violation and must do so in good
faith. Knowingly reporting false or frivolous information is contrary to
this Policy. 7.2. Failure to disclose or disputes over whether a
conflict exists may be referred to the Board for resolution. Failure to
disclose a personal interest by a Board Member who represents an
organization shall be addressed in consultation with the organization
providing that Member. 8.0. Contact Lesley-Anne Long Director, Opal,
