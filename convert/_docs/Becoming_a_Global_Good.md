Digital Square has a structured process that governs the identification
and approval of Global Goods as outlined below:

## How are Global Goods Identified {#how_are_global_goods_identified}

Digital Square identifies through our [ Open Application Process
(OAP)](Grant_Solicitation_Processes#Open_Application_Process_.28OAP.29 " Open Application Process (OAP)"){.wikilink}.
Digital Square's OAP (referred to as Notices) provides an iterative open
application process that gives applicants the opportunity to find
collaborators and provide and receive feedback from peers. Notice calls
are delineated by particular thematic or program-focused areas. An
important aspect of the Notice(s) is that the review of applications and
the investment selections are done through the engagement of a Peer
Review Committee and Investment Review Committee (respectively).

### Peer Review Committee {#peer_review_committee}

Digital Square\'s Peer Review Committee (PRC) comprises a diverse set of
the foremost leaders and thinkers in digital health technology including
country governments, donor organizations, implementing organizations,
technology vendors, and other constituencies. The PRC plays a critical
role as technical experts who assess the technical and programmatic
appropriateness of submitted concept notes and applications through
Digital Square Notices. The PRC provides feedback, which helps the
Digital Square Board to prioritize investments in high-quality digital
health products and services.

Through this process the tools and approaches submitted to the Notice
are validated as global goods through a consensus approach of the
broader public and digital health community represented by the PRC.

## How to become a global good {#how_to_become_a_global_good}

As global goods are identified and approved through the Digital Square
Notices, for a tool to be identified as a global good it must have a
successful outcome in an active Digital Square Notice.

In addition to this a tool can align itself to the principles of being a
Global Good and ensure that it meets the criteria of the definition of a
global good (see above) and undertake a self evaluation of its own
maturity using the [ Global Goods Maturity
Model](Global_Goods_Maturity#Digital_Square_Maturity_Model_Details " Global Goods Maturity Model"){.wikilink}.
The Global Goods Maturity Model helps identify areas of investments for
global goods, as well as provides a view of the tool, community and use
that can guide tool owners in making decisions as to how and where they
would like to invest in maturing their tool.

**\"Global Goods are tools that have been selected through the Digital
Square Notice process and the review by the Peer Review Committee\"**
