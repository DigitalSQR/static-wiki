Digital Square's FHIR-focused webinar series provides guidance to help digital health developers, innovators, digital public goods and global goods developers, and implementers better understand how to use FHIR to address specific use cases, such as technical guidance for COVID-19 vaccination certificates. This work also increases the maturity of FHIR through the use and feedback to HL7 through their collaborative process.

Digital Square hosts monthly webinars to enhance digital health's capacity. The FHIR training material on this site is designed for digital health leaders with some or limited prior experience and knowledge of FHIR. All sessions are recorded and shared here.
