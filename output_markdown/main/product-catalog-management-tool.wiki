=Product Catalog Management Tool=
The Project Catalog Management Tool (PCMT) aims to connect product catalogs in order to show a clear journey from manufacturer to patient.  

===Approach=== 
PCMT establishes master data that includes GS1 identifiers, global categories, and mappings to local identifiers. This enables end-to-end visibility, allows shipments to flow between systems, and helps supply chains perform. The tool is primarily used by product managers, national regulatory bodies, pharmacy data managers and logistics managers. PCMT is used to manage product information of health commodities and trade items across organizational systems. 

===Implementations=== 
PCMT is being used to manage product catalogs at the national level in multiple countries, and in two â€œglobal" organization implementations to coordinate catalog identifiers across member countries. In the African region, the tool is used in Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Zambia.
