The Navigator for Digital Health Capability Models (also called the 'Navigator') enables health systems planners, implementors, evaluators, and funders to understand the value of using maturity model-based tools, identify and use the most appropriate tool(s), and leverage past maturity model-based assessments to improve digital health capabilities at the national and sub-national levels.

The Navigator includes the following components:

The appendix provides an in-depth mapping of indicators between the six maturity model-based tools in the Navigator.

==== Technical brief: The need for a Digital Health Maturity Model Navigator ====
An early step in the process of developing the Navigator for Digital Health Capability Models was to interview tool developers, implementors, and country stakeholders to better understand motivations and goals in using maturity model-based tools. This technical brief summarizes those interviews.

The Navigator includes six maturity model-based tools:

The Navigator was developed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Digital Square, with funding and technical advisory support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). An advisory team composed of representatives from USAID, the World Health Organization, World Bank, the United Nations Children’s Fund, Country Health Information Systems and Data Use (CHISU) / John Snow, Inc., and the Kati Collective provided input and suggestions. Members of the Digital Health and Interoperability Working Group’s Small Working Group on maturity models provided valuable input and feedback on the various iterations of the Navigator and contributed to the Navigator’s testing.
