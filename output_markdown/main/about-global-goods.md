## What are Global Goods?

Digital Square Global Goods are digital health tools which are open
source (FOSS), have no barrier to access for services or available under
open content licenses etc, are supported by an anchor
organization/strong community, have a clear governance structures, have
been deployed at scale, are used across multiple countries, have
demonstrated effectiveness, are designed to be interoperable, and are on
a continuum towards sustainability for the tool/service.

When open-source software tools are configured to work together to
support a functional domain (such as immunization, antenatal care, etc.)
these can be described as

## Global Goods vs DPGs

Digital Square Global Goods are a collection of Digital Public Goods
that are focused on health, are impactful, scalable and adaptable to
different countries and contexts, strive for interoperability and are
designed for use primarily in low and middle income country (LMIC)
settings.

In short, all Global Goods are Digital Public Goods, but not all Digital
Public Goods are Global Goods.

## Shelf Readiness & Maturity Model

The term "shelf readiness" stems from the need to ensure that digital
health global goods, particularly software, are ready to be deployed as
stand-alone products which meet the primary data use needs of a tool.
Shelf readiness aims to allow implementers and decision makers to have a
higher level of confidence in the solutions as they would be well
presented in their product information, ability to perform desired
functions as well as interoperability workflows / metadata
synchronizations and deployment aspects, to name a few areas.

Digital Square funds a maturity model baseline assessments and
reassessments of global goods

## The Testing Harness

Digital Square has supported the development of a test harness and
testing framework that will facilitate testing the conformance of
technologies to the OpenHIE Architecture specification and health and
data content, as specified by WHO SMART Guidelines. This testing
solution will be leveraged by anyone wanting to test compliance of
digital health solutions to WHO SMART Guidelines compliance requirements
and/or their own defined requirements.
