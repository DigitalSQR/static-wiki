Digital Square is expanding engagement and support to all approved global good implementers through our Notice cycles as well as our request for application (RFA)s (non-Notice cycle awards). In March 2019, we began offering monthly Global Good Webinars for the global good innovator community. The topics of the webinars range from technical, operational, and communications topics. Digital Square intends for these webinars to be an opportunity for the community to share, learn, and engage both with each other as well as the Peer Review Committee members, who are also invited to these webinars.

==Global Good Webinars==
===June 28, 2023 | Notice G1: Informational Session===
Digital Square has launched its second-round global call dedicated to content global goods under Notice G. A content global good is a resource, toolkit, or data standard that is available under an open license and is used to improve or analyze the capabilities required to manage health data, digital tools, systems, governance, and processes. This session walks through the request for expression of interest and the content maturity model, as well as provides a real-time question-and-answer session with the project team.

===April 13, 2023 | Taking Stock - Lessons and next steps for COVID-19 digital health investments in LMICs===
USAID, UNICEF, DICE, and Digital Square hosted this webinar to take stock of digital health investments made to support COVID-19 vaccination service delivery, exploring successes, challenges, and future plans for digital systems. The webinar highlights experiences from Kenya and Sri Lanka, and offers insights that can be useful in the face of future health threats. The webinar also marks the launch of the Digital Health Centre of Excellence (DICE) Primer on Digital Solutions for COVID-19 Vaccination Service Delivery. The Primer was originally designed as an easy-to-use cheat sheet to help stakeholders engaged in COVID-19 vaccination efforts leverage data and digital health tools while addressing long-term sustainability challenges. DICE is publishing the resource now, as its applicability extends beyond the circumstances that prompted its creation to future pandemic threat preparedness, resilient health systems, and ongoing COVID-19 and routine immunization efforts.
