## Standards for Health Information Exchange

Digital health technology is at the core of modern, equitable health
care systems. When designed and employed effectively, systems can
seamlessly exchange information, leading to improved clinical decisions
and outcomes, care coordination, and operational efficiency. This
interoperability is made possible through health data standards for
digital technologies, which ensure data is uniformly and efficiently
exchanged across systems. Digital Square supports the global digital
health community, including country governments, in understanding,
aligning, and applying these standards.

## Creating interoperable systems prepared to swiftly advance digital health transformation

Interoperable software enables different systems to speak the same
language, regardless of differences in interfaces, platforms, and
technologies. A suite of interoperable information systems can track and
communicate varied data such as staff availability, number of supplies
or equipment, or patient health records.

This smooth data exchange is possible because the software exists in an
integrated digital ecosystem that adheres to a common set of standards
rather than in data silos. According to [Health Level Seven
International (HL7)](https://www.hl7.org/), a nonprofit standards
development organization, software standards act as “a set of rules that
allow information to be shared in a uniform and consistent manner across
any application.” Interoperability based on standards enables not only
faster implementation but also higher-quality data and improved
maintainability, thus positively impacting healthcare workers’ and
patients’ lives

Investing in standards development, adoption, and dissemination is key
for having interoperable systems. This investment is [recognized as
essential](https://www.oecd.org/development-cooperation-learning/practices/usaid-promotes-co-ordinated-investments-in-digital-systems-for-better-health-outcomes-e424b58b/)
to the delivery of public services by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) and is integral to the [World Health
Organization’s (WHO’s) digital health
strategy](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/gs4dhdaa2a9f352b0445bafbc79ca799dce4d.pdf?sfvrsn=f112ede5_48).
Standards investments also lead to a wide range of improvements. As
government and facility workforces adopt and become familiar with these
systems, digital tools can generate the following benefits to advance
health outcomes:

- Facilitate operational ease and efficiency for policymakers, health
  workers, and facility managers.
- Create new opportunities for data sharing, visualization, and
  analytics to enable quicker decision-making.
- Reduce the time and cost of troubleshooting information technology
  (IT) and operational problems such as managing stockouts, conducting
  data entry, and implementing digital workarounds.
- Reuse existing work and lower the cost of the development of new
  features and software among users, increasing efficiencies in the
  health system.
- Provide the basis for systems and people to collaborate so the focus
  can be on the health and well-being of patients.

By establishing a common foundation and set of tools, software can rely
on consistent input from other systems, creating space for stakeholders
to swiftly propel digital innovations forward while focusing on what
counts: the provision and management of health care.

## Engaging with countries and the broader global goods community to support the development of and adherence to standards

Digital Square is committed to transforming digital ecosystems to
advance health equity and is therefore, very active in the standards
space. The initiative has adopted a multipronged approach to supporting
adherence to standards by focusing on advocacy, leadership on standards
committees, knowledge sharing, support for global goods partners,
solving for country and partner needs, and collaboration with global
leaders.

### Advocacy

Digital Square’s advocacy efforts promote the appropriate use of
standards in health system design and support technical teams in
adopting standards in their tools. This work also considers ways to
improve upon these tools and advocates for consistent ways to
standardize software to address common problems implementers face.

### Leadership on standards committees

Digital Square also holds active and chairing positions across many
standards development organizations. In these roles, our technical team
helps refine and develop standards, building on our experience working
with global goods partners and country implementers. The following are
committees where Digital Square holds leadership roles, including chair
and co-chair positions:

- **Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise’s (IHE’s) IT Infrastructure
  Technical Committee.** This committee supports the implementation of
  standards-based interoperability solutions to improve information
  sharing, workflow, and patient care. The committee assesses the
  feasibility and scope of proposals, develops detailed documentation of
  approved proposals, and develops and maintains the IHE Technical
  Framework. Much of our engagement has been in co-authoring standards
  profiles (i.e., mCSD, PMIR, SVCM) related to the U.S. President’s
  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) systems and OpenHIE
  activities.
- **HL7 Belgium**. This committee provides advice and accelerates
  standardization to consequently improve time to market and safety of
  connected health systems. It also grows and sustains the HL7
  implementer community, gathers health care standardization efforts,
  and contributes to the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources®
  (FHIR®) community. Finally, HL7 Belgium showcases Belgium’s FHIR
  adoption as a strong example of rapid and proper adoption of a new
  standard.
- **Open Health Information Exchange’s (OpenHIE’s) Architecture Review
  Board**. The board makes decisions about standards and specifications
  for OpenHIE. Committee members develop and inform a dynamic, viable,
  and reusable OpenHIE architectural model based on countries’
  experiences implementing standards.

Digital Square staff are also members of the following committees:

- IHE’s Quality, Research, and Public Health Committee
- IHE’s pharmacy committee
- HL7
- ISO TC 215 Working Group

### Knowledge Sharing

Digital Square facilitates webinars, workshops, and open discussions to
raise awareness of standards, increase feasibility, and contribute to a
range of tools that allow users to recognize the short- and long-term
impact of the standards. The initiative also provides many opportunities
for knowledge sharing and continued learning to support implementation
teams’ widespread development and understanding of standards. Through
the use of webinars, trainings, and implementation guides, Digital
Square creates opportunities for partners to deeply engage in the
subject matter and feel equipped to begin transforming their own digital
health systems.

- One notable [webinar
  series](https://wiki.digitalsquare.io/index.php/Digital_Square_on_FHIR)
  centered on the FHIR standard. Through the series, Digital Square
  delivered workshop-like sessions to recap the basics of the standard
  and guide partners through its implementation.
- This series was accompanied by monthly, audience-led “FHIR-side”
  chats, which allowed partners to engage more deeply on the topic, pose
  questions to experts, and establish connections to the broader FHIR
  community.

### Support for Global Goods Partners

To complement this work, Digital Square actively convenes a cadre of
approved [global
goods](https://wiki.digitalsquare.io/index.php/Main_Page#Global_Goods)
partners and provides ongoing support to a range of other global goods
partners within the space. The initiative funds select projects proposed
by global goods partners and ensures these projects promote
interoperability, the adoption of appropriate standards, and
documentation of standard adherence as needed. Examples of Digital
Square’s funding to take standards activities forward include the
following:

- Digital Square is funding the reference instantiation of the WHO
  [Digital Adaptation Kit for Antenatal
  Care](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240020306) in key
  software tools. Digital adaptation kits (DAKs) are software-neutral
  documentation that transform clinical and public health guidelines
  into a format easily understood by digital systems. The DAK on
  antenatal care tailored this documentation.
- Digital Square [has funded the social enterprise technology company
  Ona](https://applications.digitalsquare.io/content/improving-automated-testing-interoperability-and-privacy-open-smart-register-platform)
  for its work on the global good Open Smart Register Platform
  (OpenSRP). Ona is taking an “all-in” approach, [the next
  generation](https://ona.io/home/introducing-opensrp-fhircore-why-we-are-going-all-in-on-fhir/advancing)
  of OpenSRP to be built with a FHIR Core base.
- Digital Square has supported and engaged with WHO, Ona, and Google.
  These organizations have engaged in developing the FHIR SDK, a set of
  libraries to build healthcare applications using the FHIR standard, to
  better facilitate the adoption of HL7 FHIR on mobile devices.

Digital Square has and continues to be one of the leading advocates for
the adoption of FHIR in the global goods community and supports the
incorporation of the standard in global goods tools (e.g., Everwell,
Reveal, OpenHIM, OpenMRS, OpenIMIS, and more).

### Solving country and partner needs

Digital Square is also collaborating with a range of stakeholders to
identify and improve upon frequently occurring challenges to deploy
solutions more effectively. These solutions include:

- Promoting standard data architecture to avoid misaligned common data
  models.
- Managing data to facilitate the sharing of product catalogs.
- Addressing challenges to feasibility to increase access to flexible
  digital solutions.
- Ensuring a consistent approach to population data analysis to generate
  high-quality data.

Developing documentation for standards, including documentation in a
range of languages, to facilitate ease and efficiency.

### Collaboration with global leaders

In addition to advising on standards development and technical ecosystem
design, Digital Square has engaged more broadly with global leaders to
advance the ecosystem of standards for open-source technologies. The
initiative:

- Supports WHO in adapting health guidelines to a computable form,
  improving the adherence of digital tools to clinical guidelines.
- Advocates for the widespread adoption of the HL7 FHIR standard in
  partnership with WHO and USAID.
- Chaired the [OpenHIE COVID-19 Task
  Force](https://digitalsquare.org/blog/2021/11/1/developing-a-solution-to-enhance-covid-19-data-exchange),
  a group that addressed the need for data-sharing and interoperability
  at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, exemplifying how standards
  accelerate the strategic use of tools in epidemics and pandemics.

## Continuing standards advancement for high-quality and contextualized health data systems

Digital Square will continue advancing interoperability standards to
increase the world’s preparedness for sharing data, facilitate the
seamless connection of health data sources, and enable high-quality and
secure data-sharing. At the same time, these efforts will strive to
continue supporting the different contexts, processes, needs, and pace
of communities.

“Standards \[do not impose\] one single model for providing health care
but rather enable the required variability that allows the different
models and processes central to health care—along a patient’s life and
across the globe—\[to\] seamlessly interoperate.” — ROB HORN, SYSTEM
ARCHITECT

As an initiative that closely collaborates with both standards
committees and country implementation teams, Digital Square is uniquely
positioned to feed insights back from on-the-ground implementers to
committee members. This feedback loop helps ensure that standards are
realistic and valuable to country teams. These attributes are essential
for seamless implementation and long-term sustainability of digital
health interventions.
