The OpenELIS Global software is an enterprise-level laboratory information system built on open-source web-based technologies that has been tailored for low-and-middle income country public health laboratories. 

===Approach=== 
The software serves as both an effective laboratory software solution and business process framework. It supports the effective functioning of public health laboratories for best laboratory practice and accreditation.  

OpenELIS offers functionality suitable for supporting jobs and workflows of laboratory technicians, laboratory managers, and public health epidemiologists. Laboratory technicians can use the system to capture data on laboratory orders, tests, and results.  Laboratory managers can use the system to track laboratory quality assurance processes. Public health epidemiologists can use OpenELIS data in a central data repository for disease surveillance.  The system is suitable for use in any clinical lab, but it is specifically designed for public health labs in limited resource settings. 

===Implementations===
OpenELIS is implemented nationally in Cote d’Ivoire, Mauritius, and Haiti. It has implementations in at least 192 labs, with many more using the 1.x version bundled in Bahmni Hospital Operating System.
