Digital Square defines product suites as a configuration of open-source technologies and tools that are aligned to meet a functional domain (such as immunization, antenatal care, etc.) and support standards-based data exchange. The product suites package digital tools together and exchange data through appropriate data exchange patterns to achieve a desired set of functionality and outcomes. Product suites leverage international guidance documents, such as the WHO Digital Adaptation Kits (DAKs), to frame the expected system-wide flows and functionalities.   
 
Product suites must meet defined functional and non-functional requirements to ensure all major functional areas are catered for and core non-functional needs are considered.  
 
Product suites must support appropriate standards-based data exchange to achieve a fully interoperable solution. Data exchange should be enabled through adherence to globally recognized standards with the Open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) specified workflows where relevant. Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the preferred open standard, and work on product suites should reference and contribute to the development of the WHO L3 work.  
  
Product suites must be comprised of recognized global goods and/or technologies that meet the definition of [[Digital Square Global Goods]].
