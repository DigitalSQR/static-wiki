== What we do ==

Digital health technology is at the core of modern, equitable health care systems. When designed and employed effectively, systems can seamlessly exchange information, leading to improved clinical decisions and outcomes, care coordination, and operational efficiency. This interoperability is made possible through health data standards for digital technologies, which ensure data is uniformly and efficiently exchanged across systems. Digital Square supports the global digital health community, including country governments, in understanding, aligning, and applying these standards.

|title1=Understanding Reveal implementation in LMICs: A case study of Kenya, Senegal, and Zambia
|date = November 10, 2022
|description1 = Digital Square has launched the global goods open mic webinar series, a platform for our global goods partners to share their implementation journey in LMICs, working with country governments, donors, implementers, and health workers to deliver patient-centered healthcare. In this first session, we host Akros, who has spearheaded the development and community around Reveal, a digital global good that uses spatial intelligence to drive the delivery of life-saving interventions to the last mile. Akros shares its work with multiple countries and donors to apply geospatial data to plan and deliver health campaigns and routine services, demonstrates the use of Reveal, and showcases use cases summarizing geospatial data activation across the spectrum from low-tech paper maps to higher-tech navigation and delivery in Kenya, Senegal, and Zambia.
