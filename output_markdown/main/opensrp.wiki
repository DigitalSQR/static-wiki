=OpenSRP=
OpenSRP is an open source mobile health platform that allows frontline health workers to electronically register and track the health of their entire client population. 

===Approach=== 
OpenSRP provides the core functionalities needed for community health workers and health workers at facilities to provide primary health services.  This includes registering patients and households, entering them into scheduled care plans where provision of care can be tracked and guiding the health worker through WHO designed clinical assessments to ensure quality of care.   At the community level, OpenSRP provides the core CHW modules to provide care primarily around RMNCH. At the facility, OpenSRP provides support for core health modules including Immunization, ANC, PNC, Family Planning, Labor and Delivery and outpatient. The primary end users are community health workers and health facility staff typically nurse midwifes, doctors or medical officers. 

===Implementations===
OpenSRP is used around the world by ministries of health, implementing partners, and technical partners. This includes national scale adoption, for example in Tanzania.
