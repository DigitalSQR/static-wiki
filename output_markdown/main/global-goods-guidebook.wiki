With the Global Goods Guidebook, Digital Square is showcasing some of the emergent and
established global goods that have been invested or deployed as a result of
our unique, open approach.  The Digital Investment Principles have described the need for donors
to align around scalable, sustainable, accessible, interoperable, and
evidence-based digital health global goods that meet country priorities.
Digital health global public goods have an important role to play in moving
the needle from a past era of digital health donor funding characterized
by pilots and other proof-of-concept demonstrations to a future guided by
investments in country-led and country-managed digital health strategies
and systems that can be independently operated, expanded, and
sustained by host governments and local partners over time.

The global health community needs to move away from the current
practice of single application solutions to a more strategic approach that
acts holistically with both current country priorities and long-term goals
for health system strengthening. By better coordinating the development
of digital health global goods, such as those presented in this guidebook,
stakeholders involved in digital health can reduce duplication and ensure
that platforms are not only more aligned with priorities but that they
strengthen national systems

This Global Goods guidebook focuses a living
document with regular revisions. The information in this guidebook has been provided by the global goods
themselves and has not been validated by Digital Square for accuracy.
