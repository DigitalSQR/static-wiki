\_\_TOC\_\_ Digital Square practice is to pursue competitive
solicitation processes to facilitate Digital Square outgoing agreements,
wherever possible. A competitive process provides capable entities the
opportunity to submit applications in a fair and transparent process for
a committee to evaluate applications and select the successful
applicant(s). In order to foster competition in alignment with
Initiative expectations, Digital Square will release three types of
solicitations to support programmatic objectives: [^1]

  
1\. Requests for Applications (RFAs)[^2]

2\. Open Application Process (OAP)

3\. Open Requests for Application (ORFAs)

The selection of the successful candidate(s) and the final funding
decision(s), inclusive of an allocated award amount(s), may be made by
the investor or the Digital Square
<a href="Board" class="wikilink" title="Board">Board</a> (Board). This
determination is made prior to solicitation release and will depend on:

  
A. Whether the investor has specific business requirements attached to
the funding opportunity. This may include the time frames for which
funding is available or the need to coordinate with other
investments.[^3]

B. Whether the investor elects to use Digital Square’s Investment Review
Committee through the open application process (OAP) and relinquish the
funding decision to the
<a href="Board" class="wikilink" title="Board">Board</a>.[^4]

To review active RFAs, navigate to [Digital Square’s solicitations
website](http://digitalsquare.org/solicitations). For more information
on the overall process for selected applicants, please review the

## Types of solicitations

### Request for Application (RFA)

An RFA will result in a grant to support programmatic objectives.
Investors may want to engage Digital Square in a particular thematic or
program-focused area; in these cases, will facilitate a release of an
RFA.

The following is a description phase and steps of an RFA process:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 20%;"><p><strong>Step #: Summary</strong></p></td>
<td style="width: 60%;"><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" style="text-align: center"><p><strong><em>Preparation
Phase</em></strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Step 1: Solicitation preparation</p></td>
<td><p>Digital Square works with the investor to refine the scope of
work for the solicitation, including the timeline. An RFA is appropriate
if the selected applicant will have its performance measured against
programmatic objectives; responsibility for programmatic
decision-making; and responsibility for adherence to funder
requirements. An RFA will result in Digital Square issuing a
subagreement. For active RFAs, <a
href="http://digitalsquare.org/solicitations">visit the solicitations
page of the Digital Square website</a>. A solicitation will include:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
1 Basis for why the solicitation needs to be done.
</dd>
<dd>
2 Information to which the applicant’s scope of work and cost proposal
must comply to be considered for selection.
</dd>
<dd>
3 Basis and criteria for which the applicant will be fairly evaluated,
scored, and decisions made.
</dd>
<dd>
4 Terms and conditions that the applicant will be required to abide by
if selected.
</dd>
<dd>
5 Process for applicant queries.

<tr>
<td><p>Step 2: Release Solicitation</p></td>
<td><p>Digital Square issues the RFA on the solicitation page of Digital

</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Step 3: Determine evaluation committee</p></td>
<td><p>In collaboration with the investor, Digital Square will establish
an evaluation committee to review the RFA. The minimum standard for an
evaluation committee is that it must include:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
1. An odd number of evaluators <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>(i.e., at least 3
people).
</dd>
<dd>
2. Two of the evaluators must be people from Digital Square, one each
from the technical and operational teams. Representation from both the
technical and operations teams will bring an operational view to the
evaluation in addition to the technical perspective.
</dd>
<dd>
3. An investor may elect to be part of the evaluation committee or
assign delegates. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Evaluation committee members must disclose any conflicts of interest,
to the program contact, to ensure there is no selection bias.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Step 4: Evaluation Committee review</p></td>
<td><p>The evaluation committee reviews applications according to
evaluation criteria and scores submissions based on the RFA.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Step 5: Evaluation Committee Review Meeting</p></td>
<td><p>Evaluation committee meets to discusses their review and scores,
and a recommendation is made. If the funder is part of the evaluation
committee step 6 is skipped.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Step 6: Funder review</p></td>
<td><p>Digital Square compiles the applications, budget, and breakdown
of the evaluation committee and provides them to the investor who makes
the decision for funding.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Step 7: Board notification</p></td>
<td><p>Digital Squares notifies the <a href="Board" class="wikilink"
title="Board">Board</a> of the funder evaluation and funding decision.
This step will occur during routine <a href="Board" class="wikilink"
title="Board">Board</a> communications.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Step 8: Award</p></td>
<td><p>The result of the funder decision and evaluation committee
feedback is communicated to the applicants.</p></td>

### Open Application Process (OAP)

Digital Square also provides an iterative open application process (OAP)
that gives applicants the opportunity to find collaborators and provide
and receive feedback from peers. Digital Square’s global good team
facilitates a regular OAP solicitation referred to as a “Notice.” A
single Notice may issue multiple calls for funding (with respective
RFAs) in accordance with investor roadmaps and may pool investor
funding. Notice calls are delineated by particular thematic or
program-focused areas. A Notice follows preparation through the
application phase (steps 1-4) but the review & investment stage includes
the engagement of a Peer Review Committee and Investment Review
Committee, see steps 5B-8B.

The following outlines the steps & timelines of an open application
process:

<td><p>Step 2: Concept note development and community review</p></td>
<td><p>Digital Square issues a call for applications, and applicants
upload concept notes to Digital Square's public-facing <a
href="https://applications.digitalsquare.io/">open application
platform</a>. In the first few weeks, as outlined by the solicitation,
applicants will submit concept notes. Before the final submission, other
applicants and/or other stakeholders in the community may provide
feedback, comments, and suggestions, as well as identify potential areas
for collaboration if the early draft of the concept note is published on
the platform. Digital Square encourages an agile approach of development
with early publication of draft concept notes to the platform and
applicants are encouraged to edit and respond to community feedback, on
their concept note, during this time Following this the final version of
the concept note must be submitted and applicants must use the <a

note template</a>.</p></td>
<td><p>| 4 weeks</p></td>

<tr>
<td><p>Step 3: Digital Square review of concept notes</p></td>
<td><p>Following the concept note review, Digital Square (comprised of
the technical and operational team representatives) assesses concept
notes to ensure alignment with the initiative vision and funding
objectives identified in the open application process. Digital Square
eliminates concept notes that are not strategically aligned with the
above. Digital Square identifies a set of short-listed concept notes
based on the open application process criteria and emails applicants who
are eligible to advance to the application phase.</p></td>

interim reviews of their applications. Only one review may be requested
from Digital Square, and unlimited reviews from the community are
allowed. Using feedback, applicants revise the <a

narrative, and submit these to the Digital Square <a

are not shared publicly on the platform. Commenters see only the
high-level summary budget provided in the technical application. At the
conclusion of this step, Digital Square will restrict the ability to
