## What we do

Digital health technology is at the core of modern, equitable health care systems. When designed and employed effectively, systems can seamlessly exchange information, leading to improved clinical decisions and outcomes, care coordination, and operational efficiency. This interoperability is made possible through health data standards for digital technologies, which ensure data is uniformly and efficiently exchanged across systems. Digital Square supports the global digital health community, including country governments, in understanding, aligning, and applying these standards.
