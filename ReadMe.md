\_\_NOTOC\_\_= Welcome to the Digital Square Wiki! = Digital Square is a
digital health marketplace (or 'square') where supply and demand come
together to accelerate health equity. We connect health leaders with the
resources necessary for digital transformation. Digital Square is housed
at PATH, and supported by USAID, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
and a consortium of other donors. For more Information visit our

global goods and other areas.

## What we do

Digital health technology is at the core of modern, equitable health
care systems. When designed and employed effectively, systems can
seamlessly exchange information, leading to improved clinical decisions
and outcomes, care coordination, and operational efficiency. This
interoperability is made possible through health data standards for
digital technologies, which ensure data is uniformly and efficiently
exchanged across systems. Digital Square supports the global digital
health community, including country governments, in understanding,
aligning, and applying these standards.
