| '''Digital Health Atlas'''
||
: As part of the global COVID19 response, the WHO has enhanced the Digital Health Atlas to provide support for governments and investors focused on scaling effective digital health implementations. Key features:
:* 1. Enhanced MOH pages, able to store reference documents of national relevance (policies, investment plans, maturity assessments, etc) 
:* 2. Documentation of Project Phases providing DHA users with insights regarding the progress of a project along the software development life cycle (from ideation to scaled implementation)
:* 3. Facilitating the labeling and description of multi-country deployments as  "Global Initiatives". 
:* 4. Facilitating the labeling of a project as research-focused and time-bound, allowing researchers to share time-critical insights and progress into Covid-19 and digital health directly with Ministries of Health and Investors

=COVID-19 Community Coordination=

Digital Square is pleased to share resources sourced from the Digital Health Community to facilitate alignment and coordination in the COVID-19 response, and to support countries choosing digital tools to aid in their own response efforts.  If you have a resource you would like us to host on the wiki, please contact [mailto:abendor@path.org Amanda BenDor].

===UNICEF Country Mapping for COVID-19 Response===

UNICEF has initiated a '''country mapping''' of relevant Digital Health solutions that can be leveraged to support frontline health workers in their response to COVID-19 and that can be used by countries to support Risk Communication and Community Engagement on COVID-19. The mapping can be accessed [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GbM1nuHxnCvoc1hLLcQAt7QOoQxnAXdI3hdP3Qt7KUg/edit?usp=sharing here].  If you want to update the country mapping, please use the comment function and the UNICEF team will update the information accordingly. 

Likewise, a '''partnership landscaping''' has also been done to map where implementing partners are working to support digital tools for frontline health workers and which digital solutions they are supporting. This mapping can be accessed [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y6fl3Uqvn0lcFhBlYPXLKKi2HXi79kw8pWR_h8PwE3s/edit?usp=sharing here]. If your organization is missing from the partnership landscaping, you can add the information directly in the spread sheet.
 
Both these mapping tools are free to use by anyone who wish to know which solutions already exist at country level and that can be deployed for frontline health workers for COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.

=Comparison of Digital Tools used in the COVID-19 Response=

Countries have access to a large, complex ecosystem of digital platforms that can support COVID-19 response. The process of selecting the most appropriate platform for a country's specific needs or context can be overwhelming without clear information about the benefits and limitations of the options. Several new resources have been developed to support in-country assessment and decisions about digital technologies for COVID response. 

===Johns Hopkins assessment===
In July 2020, Johns Hopkins published an assessment of digital platforms that have an established presence in several low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), and either have been or could be rapidly reconfigured to address COVID-19 related case management and contact tracing needs.  The assessment includes a review of the following tools: CommCare, Community Health Toolkit (CHT), DHIS2 Tracker, Go.Data, ODK, OpenSRP, RapidPro, SORMAS, and WelTel. The platforms were selected based on their existing deployment, flexibility, and adaptability for COVID-19 use cases, their ability to support multiple languages, and stakeholder interest in how these applications can be leveraged in response to COVID-19. The full report can be accessed [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yCP7t1di_ofQ0YhuPAD1Oqcj1aTo74k5/view here]. 

===Digital Square efforts===
In recognition that this is a rapidly evolving landscape, Digital Square has been working across donors to collate a comparison of digital tools that are currently used in the COVID-19 response. Included in the comparison is an analysis of a number of functional and non-functional requirements.  Including in this document are the following digital health tools: DHIS2, SORMAS, Go.Data, EpiInfo, CommCare, ODK, Kobo Toolbox, Excel and non-digital paper tools. This comparison is a dynamic document meant for community updates that can be accessed [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cMQAZO94uTe4HULLmBRN80fPnNUwayqw3e2UT-voJbw/edit?usp=sharing here].  If you would like to make updates including adding additional tools or information to tools included, please contact [mailto:cfourie@path.org Carl Fourie].

====Map &amp; Match====
The USAID-funded Map &amp; Match project helps countries, donors, implementing partners, and the global digital health community at large to leverage and adapt existing digital tools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world learned during the West Africa Ebola outbreak response, prioritizing the reuse and adaptation of existing digital tools is vital to quickly scale access to time-sensitive disease information and data. 
[https://digitalsquare.org/covid19-map-match '''Find Map &amp; Match resources on the Digital Square website here.''']

*In March 2021, Digital Square published the [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59bc3457ccc5c5890fe7cacd/t/603d549f3e5f2c2800651483/1614632096462/DATEC-FINAL.pdf ''Digital Applications and Tools Across an Epidemiological Curve'']. This resource provides a strategic framework for governments, investors, implementing organizations, and the digital health community to better understand how existing digital tools can be adapted and used during different phases of an outbreak.

=Country Support=

==Mali==
With funding from USAID Mali, Digital Square is working closely with the Mali Ministry of Health and partners such as CDC, Gavi, UNICEF and Global Fund to support adaptation and scale of digital health tools to support the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.  Through the end of 2021, Digital Square is specifically supporting the following activities:

# Adapt and scale existing health information systems for COVID-19 vaccine rollout to enable real-time monitoring of vaccine availability and vaccine coverage.
# Support MOH to transition existing paper-based systems to digital platforms (focus on digital tools for monitoring adverse side effects).
# Harness digital tools to identify and locate persons eligible for vaccination.
# Identify tools and applications to be made interoperable.
# Contribute to an evaluation of a vaccination campaign in Bamako.

For more information on these activities or to coordinate with the Digital Square team, [mailto:cbowman@path.org please contact Caitlin Bowman].
